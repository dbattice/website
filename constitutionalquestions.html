This is politics, to the extent people disagree about how the government should be structured. 
Here is a footnote.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footer1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> 
And another.<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footer1" id="ref2">2</a></sup>
</p>
<p>This page is how I would write a constitutional document for a country, especially the United States.
This mainly concerns elections, political actors, their responsibilities, and building in robustness and change.
Will also plan to add a section on why some reforms are needed today, post Covid. 
</p>
<h4>Base line reforms that are not partisan and would improve governance</h4>
<p>Off cycle elections are also bad, so the states that have state elections in odd years should move their elections 
by one year so they are at the same time as presidential or midterm elections. 
For pro federalism reasons, the federal government could be way more constructive by doing things 
with state heterogeneity in mind. This would take the form of more explicit state control, less constraining regulations and 
mandates, or lots of opt-outs or options built into laws, programs, and regulations. Also radically changing budgeting, 
which will be the focus later in this article. 
(Also, South Dakota v. Dole, which I think is wrong, not mention the SCOTUS cases over the ACA.)
</p>
<p>
Looking at other countries, I am surprised we don't have an instution where states can exert power 
within the federal government. Canada and Australia have councils of premiers where the premiers of each 
state/province and the prime minister/cabinet meet and work out agreements. Germany's Bundesrat or 'upper chamber' is composed 
of members chosen entirely by state cabinets and each state's members must exercise their power together, 
but also get no say over non-state affairs. 
Czech Senate must consent to treaties, electoral law and constitutional changes. 
Czech Senate also gets to confirm judges, not confidence in cabinet or ministers or budget and taxes. 
Elected by two rounds with one third elected every two years. 
Italy has perfect bicameralism including on confidence motions. It is dumb, do not copy. 
In the Netherlands, the upper chamber is chosen based on the provincial elections, but neither the chamber nor provinces 
are particularly important. Belgium also has its upper chamber based on regional elections (that occur at the same time as 
the national elections) and then those fifty senators choose another 10 senators. In the US, the closest we have to any of this is 
governors asking Congress or the executive branch nicely. Yes, the National Governor's association exists, but I can't tell 
if they have ever meaningfully done anything. In Australia, their council of state governments played a role in Covid policy.
In Canada, they have worked out numerous agreements over time and have even proposed amendments. In Germany they are constantly 
working to hammer out deals, including a major reform in the early 2000s, but also talking through tax changes occassionally 
(probably due to Germany's tax sharing system, but still, that is a major deal that states directly influence.) 
Which is to say I think this should be a major point of potential reform. 
So I think we need an 'American Bundesrat' modeled after Germany or Belgium. 
Even an informal organization, closer to Australia, 
would be great, because it would be very hard for the American Bundesrat 
to ignore all states unified together saying the same thing. 
It seems like this could be a major way out of the muddled middle of nothing happening and everyone frustrated. 
The other reason I like this idea is because you can immediately tell if someone is serious about a policy proposal because 
you can ask if they introduced it to the American Bundesrat. It is all fine and dandy to say you 
wish the federal government would do X, but have you made a proposal to the American Bundesrat? 
</p>
<h4 id="apportionment">Apportioning the House</h4> 
<p>**For the record basically any system is better than FPTP with optional primaries as done in the US.
It would be better to be like Canada, and even better to be Australia with AV. Or just straight up two rounds 
like in France. But if you switch to proportional then there is a decent case to use MMP like Germany, 
or STV like Ireland. But I prefer open lists with members chosen based purely on votes on each list 
because it is simple and give parties the least amount of power while retaining open lists.** 
Assuming we adopt proprotional representation, how should that be done? Usually there is an electroal threshold 
of 2% to 5%. I think the House should start with a threshold of 4% or 5% to prevent to much fragmentation. 
But then how do you allocate votes with each district or nationally? Generally, there is d'Hondt or Saint-Lague, 
which are both largest remainder methods. D'Hondt method minimizes 'wasted' votes, and slightly favors larger parties 
or at least parties not splitting, while Saint-Lague is more proportional and favors smaller parties slightly. 
(Single transferable vote (STV) generally uses the Droop quota or using votes/(seats + 1). Hare quota is 
the more straight forward version of votes/seats. I would use the Droop quota if STV is used.)</p> 
<p>Leveling seats are fun. Spain, Italy, Sweden, Norway, and Finland all use different methods. Germany and UK examples 
of MMP are also different. First I want to distinguish between regional lists and with leveling seats and without. 
Spain is a great example of what happens when you set a minimum of seats per district (each province is a district), 
with no national leveling. The quota used for determining seats isn't relevant here because of the 
strength of regionalist parties in Spain. 
I think this is somewhat bad because the regionalist parties can get many seats, while broadly national parties with 
more votes get fewer seats, like Ciudadanos did a in a few elections, compared to the Basque nationalists 
and Catalan nationalists/separatists. Part of the disproportionality lies with the difference in provinces and 
a minimum for each district and wildly different populations in each district. Switzerland also has this system, 
but one district is one canton and they have a long history of the 'Magic Formula', so the 
disproportionality matters less anyway.
For contrast, Finland basically uses the same list system with regional but with much more equal districts, although 
they still don't have a perfect correlation between seats and votes, but it is much better than the disparities 
in Spain. 
Norway is a very interesting case of lists and leveling seats. Norway gives out 150 seats based on population and 
area, which does have a rural bias. Each district uses open lists, and then each district has an extra seat 
for purposes of leveling. This leveling does take national vote counts into equalization, but the members 
elected in these seats still come the county list in which they were a candidate. (My opinion is that should 
more directly allocate seats based purely on population or have even more leveling seats to get increased 
proportionality.) The Norway system strikes me as a very good option that the US could emulate, especially 
if the senate becomes more like the Canadian Senate. 
Italy's current electoral system is not great for it being a list system. The first election with 
the new system resulted in an outright majority for a party that only got low 40s percent of the vote. 
They used to use '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorporo"><i>scorporo</i></a>', which is 
a form of MMP, but the rules for the proportional list seats were badly written and ended up being gamed by the political 
parties. 
Now Sweden and Denmark. Both have districts, but also have leveling seats, so 
the allocation of seats is among the lowest of any system. Sweden has a threshold nationally to get leveling seats, 
or a threshhold a party has to reach in any one district. Denmark has 'nominating districts' and a 2% 
threshhold to get levling seats. If a party wins in a nominating district, they get the seat, but almost 
every party that meets the 2% also wins at least one nominating district. The leveling seats are then apportioned 
nationally. In Sweden they go through a few steps to get to the leveling seats, but basically it allocating seats 
in each district and then they use the national totals to allocate the additional leveling seats. 
(The Netherlands basically has a national list where you only need 1/150 or .667% of the national vote to get a seat. 
They use d'Hondt so it is not the most proportional but they already have so many parties.) 
Although, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_single_vote">this</a>, 
Denmark has single vote MMP with leveling seats, but it kind of functions like open lists. 
MMP mainly used in Germany and New Zealand and subnationally in the UK. The simple version is half the seats are FPTP, 
and the rest are allocated proportionally to the party vote. (Oh yeah, every voter gets a vote for the FPTP seat 
<i>and</i> a vote for their favorite party.) The FPTP vote doesn't have to be for the same party and the second vote. 
The party seats are basically list seats, except most people are on both, and the party leaders get the top places 
on the list. The trickiness comes when you get to all the party seats and you still have disproportionality. 
You could get overhang seats, where a party won more FPTP seats than their party votes say they should have, 
for example the CDU in 2019. 
Germany also had case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_vote_weight">negative vote weight 
where votes for the party list could help rather than hurt that party. In both these cases 
Germany used to just say <i>too bad</i>. Then the Federal Constitutional Court said, <i>no, you have to keep 
adding seats to be proportional</i> (now overhang seats and leveling seats). 
This starting expanding the number of members in parliament, adding over 100 members a couple of times in a row. 
I think mostly for practical reasons, they changed this after the 2021 election. 
Germany's high threshhold and the new system could lead 
to some chaos in Bavaria in the next federal election in Germany, which will be very interesting to watch. 
The UK subnational parliaments start the divisors with the number of FPTP seats they won and then add seats to each party 
until all the designated party seats are allocated, regardless of proportionality (no overhang seats). (Some countries use or 
have used MMP but they pick a member of the party they want to vote for, eliminating ticketsplitting.) 
When they have overhang seats, they just end up not getting any list seats and divide the list seats proportionally 
until they have no more list seats, even if it is unproportional. 
New Zealand takes a different approach where the parties keep the overhang seats, but they have 
a fixed number of list seats so it ends up being more proportional (overhang seats only.)
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additional-member_system">Following the examples here</a> 
MMP with overhang and leveling is better than no leveling, which is better than AMS, which is better than FPTP, 
(although, again, anything is better than FPTP). 
There is also a positive vote transfer system where the votes for losers and surplus votes from winners 
then go toward allocating seats in the party votes/seats (which was used in Romania for an election or two, 
and for local elections in Hungary). 
More fun with a proposed system in the UK called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_vote_plus">alternative 
vote plus</a>. The idea is to use the alternative vote, like the House of Representatives in Australia, 
and then have a second 'party vote' like in Germany. 
</p>
<p>Replacing members who die resign or otherwise leave office. Germany won't let 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_system_of_Germany">overhang seats be filled</a> if member doesn't 
serve the full term. Otherwise just go to the party list. Netherlands uses lists, but if a member in office 
leaves the party, the member keeps the parliamentary seat.

<h4 id="fixingthehouse">Fixing the House: Expand the House, end primaries, and fix redistricting

A <a href="https://www.uniteamerica.org/news-article/errg-primary-blog">report</a> and a second 
<a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/analysis/are-primaries-the-problem-understanding-polarization-and-election-reform/">report</a> 
both saying that primary voters in swing districts flip elections. 
Primaries aren’t polarizing, but only the most ideological and extreme voters vote in primaries. 
This also alienates the entire other party, especially in areas where there is a massive partisan lean.
Primaries matter more than general elections in most districts.  
Lee Drutman saying that 
<a href="https://www.newamerica.org/political-reform/reports/what-we-know-about-congressional-primaries-and-congressional-primary-reform">
primaries</a> are basically about weak parties and voters not being able to distinguish moderate and extreme candidates.  
I think it is also important to get rid of primaries (my preferred solution) or use AV instead of primaries and FPTP.  
All primaries for federal races on the same day would ensure that better general election 
candidates win primaries, and that there is no distortion in presidential races due to staggered results. 
For example, I wanted to vote for Jay Inslee in the 2020 Democratic primary, but he had already dropped out, 
and it was already decided by the time I would have voted, and I didn’t even vote.

The house should be expanded to approximately 693 seats based on the cube root law 
which says to take the cube root of the population to find out how many representatives to have. 
You could also set a limit between 250,000 to 500,000 and say there will be one representative for every X people. 
All of these should scale with future population increases and censuses. 
</p>
<p>Redistricting in a comparative perspective: 
First of states should not unilaterally surrender on gerrymandering/redistricting. 
Colorado and Michigan seem to have the best <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redistricting_commission">redistricting 
commission</a>, or least the style of picking 
some Democrats, some Republicans, (probably copies California where it is actually largest and second 
largest party) and the rest being independents is the best way to go, along with having separate commissions 
for federal congressional districts and for state legislative districts. Michigan is good because 
there are more independents than either party individually. 
(Illinois has a <a href="https://redistricting.lls.edu/state/illinois/"backup commission</a>, 
which if the legislature and governor cannot make maps, 
and if still deadlocked, has the Illinois Supreme Court submit partisan nominees that are 
randomly chosen by the Secretary of State to break ties. 
<a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/4/15/5604284/us-elections-are-rigged-but-canada-knows-how-to-fix-them">Manitoba</a> 
made nonpartisan redistricting commissions which then spread to all the other provinces 
and the national parties. They are mostly judges, political scientists, and retired civil servants. 
The UK has slow moving boundaries, with elections conducted under decade old data sometimes. 
They do have independent commissions with guidelines to go with local government boundaries and 
special carve outs for some territories: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/us-and-uk-redistricting-processes/

<h4 id="senate">Fix the Senate to be truly representative of the states and to express states' power against the rest of the 
federal government</h4>
<p>Proposal to make the Senate a Bundesrat: chosen by state lower house majority. 
Minimum of two senators per state. Changes due to population take effect when the House sits after redistricting. 
Additional senators at for 1,2, 5 and every 10 million. Or just use the logarithmic formula. 
All senators from the same state must vote the same way.
Treaties still require senate approval as do constitutional amendments (confirmed by voting public). 
Also federal impeachments. Czechia requires that the senate approve electoral laws too. Every vote is majority. 
Only absolute majority for constitutional and presidential votes (for choosing president instead of electing president). 
We could do more of an Australian style upper house. Each state gets the same number of seats, is directly elected, 
territories get some representation, and uses some proportional representation method. 
I still prefer to keep the decreasingly proprotional system, like in Germany.  
Can also do reports, investigations, and introduce legislation. 
I just don't think there is much of an argument to keep the Senate wildly disproportional 
while its members are directly elected and the Senate has so much power. 
To weaken the Senate, give it the power to suspend legislation including budget and tax bills, requiring an 
absolut majority of members in the House to vote yes. 
Take away its powers for nominations and appointments. You could even go as far as the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_the_Czech_Republic">Czech Republic</a> and not allow 
the senate to vote on budgets, and its amendments or rejections of the lower house can be overtuned with an absolute majority, 
except for cases of treaties, constitutional amendments, and electoral laws, which sounds pretty good to me.

<h4 id="makepresweakagain">Make the president weak again</h4>

<a href="https://protectdemocracy.org/work/case-multiparty-presidentialism/">Lee Drutman and Scott Mainwaring</a> 
on how a multiparty House is better than two party house, 
with spillovers into the presidency and senate, especially with no primaries. 
Get rid of presidential primaries and you have to, use France's two round system, including gettting 
a certain number of senate and house members' signatures. Or better yet, use STV to elect all members 
of the collective executive. 
David Sligar once commented on twitter: why even have a head of state? Just give the prime minister or 
speaker of the legislature any roles necessary and make them accountable to parliament. My answer is to have the head of 
state chosen by parliament whether it be a governor-general or president. Or go full Switzerland and 
have a collective executive.
Interfluidity made a <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/04/24/two-kinds-of-representation/index.html">good 
distinction between a representative of all versus a representation of all</a>.
But why do we need one for all representation anyway? Just be Switzerland with a collective head of state
or choose a governor-general like former British colonies or some systems where the parliament chooses the president. 
</p>
<p>
France has a semi-presidential system. This is a weaker president, but not just ceremonial. 
The president appoints the prime minister, but the legislature can call a vote of no confidence. The president also 
calls elections and takes the lead on foreign policy and defense. 
</p>
<p>Austria, Costa Rica, France, Iceland, and Finland use the two round system to elect their presidents. Taiwan uses FPTP. 
Ireland uses ranked choice voting to elect its president. 
Greece and Malta have the parliament choose the president, and the president is very weak. 
Georgia, Germany, and Italy elect the president via special convention made of members of parliament and other 
government officials or people chosen by lower levels of government. 
The Swiss collective executive is a council of seven people chosen by all members of the parliament and 
they are voted on individually. The parties have agreed to the ‘magic formula’, where the three "biggest" 
parties each get two people in the council, and the fourth "biggest" party gets the seventh seat. 
The chair of the council, or president, rotates every year. The president does not have special powers or authority. 
There is also a vice president who generally serves as the president for the following year. 
</p>
<p>President of Austria appoints and dismisses the cabinet, same for state governments and other officials, appoints judges, 
signs laws (but can refer them to the court for constitutionality), signs treaties, and has some emergency powers. 
President of France appoints the prime minister (but he or she can be dismissed by the National Assembly), calls 
elections, does many things related to foreign policy, including the military, has emergency powers, can grant pardons
has immunity while in office, and the president of the senate takes over 
if the president leaves office before the end of the term.
Governor-General in Canada just formally appoints people, gives royal assent to bills, calls elections, and a few other ceremonial things. They are chosen by the prime minister, although recently a committee or advisory group was used to inform the decision. 
The Governor-General in Australia has basically the same power as in Canada but seemingly more discretion? 
They also are nominated (appointed) by the prime minister. 
</p>
<h4>Politics of the Future, cathedral thinking, and demographics</h4>
Cathedral thinking (doing things for a future you will not live in) is underrated, see John Gray from Dublin.  
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/ie/podcast/in-praise-of-cathedral-thinking/id1462649946?i=1000597230506">podcast</a> 
that was the inspiration for this. David McWilliams talks about John Gray who built the water system in Dublin 
and massively improved public health in Dublin because of it. David McWilliams also mentions how the people building 
cathedrals in the middle ages and early modern period would start building cathedrals that they knew wouldn't 
finish in their lifetime, but for the glory of God and future generations they did it anyway. Also, planting 
oak trees for your grandkids or that you will never sit in the shade of. George Monbiot has written or talked 
about politics of the future too. All of this is running counter to democracies being increasingly dominated by old 
people, and this is more true of voters. Why no more great cathedrals? Or grand visions in general? 

<h4>Sortition and democracy</h4> 
<p>
citizen assembly with proposal option, referendums, constitutional changes, sortition, 
</p>

<h4>Bad assumptions</h4>
<p>US political system built on false assumptions including bargaining of legislators and no parties (Steve Teles).  
I think there could be a conspiracy about veto points and inequality, where the institutions of America are hard 
to change because any sensible change would almost certainly lead to more democratic outcomes that would redistribute
income and wealth. I am mainly thinking about proportional representation or parliamentarism being correlated 
with higher life expectancy more education and economic equality. Also stronger unions. 
Also, localism doesn’t make sense with nationalized politics and political institutions, 
accountability is joke in highly polarized gerrymandered single member districts. 
The unrepresentativeness of senate and president block democratic outcomes very often.
At one point progressives thought electing separate officials at different times 
would be a check on corruption, but it turns out that now off cycle elections are bad because they are easily 
captured by special interests. And all the separate offices are hard to keep track of, and the obscure 
accountability. <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/filibuster">Matt Yglesias says the filibuster 
is bad for bargaining and compromise</a>.
The far right is rising everywhere, but electoral institutions are determining outcomes to a great extent. 
Also the far right is increasingly become so relevant that other parties are breaking the cordon sanitaire, 
for example in Germany (Mertz is signalling that maybe the AfD isn't so bad at the local level), 
Sweden (2022 election), Finland (2023 election where by the right wing coalition then broke its 
key campaign promise on debt), and of course Italy now has Meloni leading the right wing faction. 
Just want to point out that majoritarian voting systems empower the far right to take over the center right and 
thus gain outsized influence. Compare Marine Le Pen, 
Boris Johnson, Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro, Viktor Orbán, and Recep Tayyip Erdo&#x011F;an
to AfD, Sweden Democrats, PVV, and New Zealand First.

mismatches are making us unable to do stuff or make key reforms for the modern age</a>.

<h4>Transparency</h4>
<h4>Parliamentary systems are better</h4>
<p>Tiago Ribeiro dos Santos on Why not parliamentarism? Parliamentarism passes 
<a href="https://whynotparliamentarism.com/f/how-parliamentarism-passes-the-pritchett-test">Pritchet test</a> and 
<a href="https://whynotparliamentarism.com/f/parliamentarism-passes-another-test">others</a>. US works because 
president it weak. Case of Chile. I laughed at Truss Kwamikaze and the head of lettuce, but I would vastly 
prefer their parliament over out congress and president. Can also dump unpopular party leaders, 
example Truss in 2022, Trump and Biden in 2020 onwards. Or France since 2017 or so. 
At a high level, US switch to a parliament would mean the House is much more important, 
and specifically the Speaker or Majority Leader.
Juan Linz on how presidencies concentrate power in executives over time. Presidencies tend to become autocracies.
Matt Yglesias makes the point that it is easier to resolve disputes between politicians and branches in 
parliamentary systems and that parliaments can get rid of bad (or unpopular) leaders. The option of changing 
leaders is good because cabinet or PM knows if they screw up, they are out. Presidents basically always get to finish 
terms unless they voluntarily leave or die. See how impeachment and removal is basically impossible in US now.  
Bayesian case for parliamentarism a la Tiago Ribeiro dos Santos.
Sam Hammond on how parliaments are more flexible which is good for rapid technological advancement. 
To be elected PM, you have to show you would be good at it and not a celebraty or non-politician just waltzing in. 
Which almost always means being in the parliament before you are given the top job. 
<a href="https://coryhaala.org/uncategorized/too-old-us-senate-1988-north-dakota-election-burdick-colonoscopy-handshake-strinden/">This 
is a crazy story</a> of an old senator from North Dakota who crushed his opponent and then died in office about 
four years later. The broader point I want to make here is that in parliamentary systems, this guy would 
get replaced by a co-partisan and all would be fine, rather than him trying to hang on in office.

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/u33wp/is_it_true_that_democratization_has_proceeded/">Here</a> 
is a review of Mainwaring and Shugart saying presidentialism isn't a problem. They ignore the personalization 
of political parties, and I am not sure the flexibility or stability point really matters? Is 
Belgium worse than US for stability? I don't think so. 
Drutman seems to think that weak parties increase personal power and thus populism:

Paper arguing that strong executive lead to a rise in illiberalism, 
there is a tradeoff between liberty, accountability, and security, and that strong checks and balances 
slow autocratization, but also make it harder to reverse if illiberal parties gain power:

Here is a libertarian article on how minority rule is bad because it emboldens illiberalism:

<p>Also look at the countries the United States had a huge influence on those countries' constitutions. 
This includes Italy, Austria, Germany, Japan. (And Iraq? And Afghanistan?. Notice that Afghanistan had a strong president 
and it failed. Also notice that Iraq was mostly doing better but there problems are probably partly because 
of its demographics that make governing Iraq so hard.) Among the OECD countries there, notice only Austria 
elects its president directly and the Austrian president is quite weak. Japan is a constitutional monarchy, 
and Italy and Germany indirectly elect their president, both of whom have almost no power. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/mischiefs-of-faction/2019/4/11/18306412/constitution-executive-power-limits">Julia 
Azari says that the Constitution is unhelpful in constraining presidential power</a> and since the late 1800s, 
the president has become the central party politician, and now is the central figure in American politics. 
Julia Azari stumbling through 
<a href="https://gai.georgetown.edu/the-presidency-bending-institutions-to-save-them/">presidential power</a> 
and Trump vs Biden presidencies, specifically how they are viewed. Trump was chaotic and scandal ridden with no 
prior political experience. Joe Biden is exactly the oppposite and seems to get no credit for it, or at least
other things drown out what little credit he might get from that.
</p>
<p>As much disdain I have for the presidency being too powerful, the 
<a href="https://www.vox.com/mischiefs-of-faction/2019/4/9/18300749/senate-problem-electoral-college">Senate 
is probably worse</a>. The ways out of the Senate are harder. The options mentioned here are abolishing the 
filibuster, adding new states, amendments to strip the senate of power, or double amendments to make it more 
proportional or abolish the senate altogether. Senate is bad, mainly because it is so powerful and 
unrepresentative: https://secondratedemocracy.com/unrepresentative-senate/ 
</p>
<p>I do want to put <a href="https://takecareblog.com/blog/congress-s-constitution-the-president-s-politics">some 
blame on congress</a>, who seems to have not taken its role as primary actor seriously and has let the executive 
and judiciary take power without complaint. Congress can do a lot with spending decisions and require the 
president and judiciary to do certain things and can always put forth amendments and make the case for them.

<h4>Legislative procedures</h4>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riksdag">Swedish Riksdag</a>, constructive vote of no confidence, 
confidence of minister, speaker vs majority leader,
<A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Finland">Finnish Parliament</a> might be 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_Government">instructive</a>. 
<a href="https://leedrutman.substack.com/p/there-are-many-ways-to-organize-a">US house keeps changing its organization</a>, 
centralizing then decentralizing. Also discharge petitions used to be only a minority, then a majority, then they required 
public declaration that you signed the discharge petition. Very few laws have actually passed due to discharge petitions. 
Should probably concentrate power in the majority leaders hands and make the speaker the parliamentarian, more like 
how Sweden governs their Riksdag?
Suspensory veto, requiring absolute majority, Like Czechia Austria etc. 
Switzerland referendums as check on laws passed by parliament. 
Denmark requires a referendum if one third of Folketing wants one. 
Demissionary or acting cabinet. Calling early elections.

<h4 id="localgov">Local government reforms</h4>
<p>
urbanism reform, regional or metropolitan governance, parliamentarism.
How to consolidate local governments and special districts? Especially look for previous examples
Do we need municipalities and counties and special districts? Seems like special districts should 
merge into cities or counties.

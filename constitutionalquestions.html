This is politics, to the extent people disagree about how the government should be structured. 
Here is a footnote.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footer1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> 
And another.<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footer1" id="ref2">2</a></sup>
</p>
<p>This page is how I would write a constitutional document for a country, especially the United States.
This mainly concerns elections, political actors, their responsibilities, and building in robustness and change.
Will also plan to add a section on why some reforms are needed today, post Covid. 
</p>
<h4>Base line reforms that are not partisan and would improve governance</h4>
<p>Off cycle elections are also bad, so the states that have state elections in odd years should move their elections 
by one year so they are at the same time as presidential or midterm elections. 
For pro federalism reasons, the federal government could be way more constructive by doing things 
with state heterogeneity in mind. This would take the form of more explicit state control, less constraining regulations and 
mandates, or lots of opt-outs or options built into laws, programs, and regulations. Also radically changing budgeting, 
which will be the focus later in this article. 
(Also, South Dakota v. Dole, which I think is wrong, not mention the SCOTUS cases over the ACA.)
</p>
<p>
Looking at other countries, I am surprised we don't have an instution where states can exert power 
within the federal government. Canada and Australia have councils of premiers where the premiers of each 
state/province and the prime minister/cabinet meet and work out agreements. Germany's Bundesrat or 'upper chamber' is composed 
of members chosen entirely by state cabinets and each state's members must exercise their power together, 
but also get no say over non-state affairs. 
Czech Senate must consent to treaties, electoral law and constitutional changes. 
Czech Senate also gets to confirm judges, not confidence in cabinet or ministers or budget and taxes. 
Elected by two rounds with one third elected every two years. 
Italy has perfect bicameralism including on confidence motions. It is dumb, do not copy. 
In the Netherlands, the upper chamber is chosen based on the provincial elections, but neither the chamber nor provinces 
are particularly important. Belgium also has its upper chamber based on regional elections (that occur at the same time as 
the national elections) and then those fifty senators choose another 10 senators. In the US, the closest we have to any of this is 
governors asking Congress or the executive branch nicely. Yes, the National Governor's association exists, but I can't tell 
if they have ever meaningfully done anything. In Australia, their council of state governments played a role in Covid policy.
In Canada, they have worked out numerous agreements over time and have even proposed amendments. In Germany they are constantly 
working to hammer out deals, including a major reform in the early 2000s, but also talking through tax changes occassionally 
(probably due to Germany's tax sharing system, but still, that is a major deal that states directly influence.) 
Which is to say I think this should be a major point of potential reform. 
So I think we need an 'American Bundesrat' modeled after Germany or Belgium. 
Even an informal organization, closer to Australia, 
would be great, because it would be very hard for the American Bundesrat 
to ignore all states unified together saying the same thing. 
It seems like this could be a major way out of the muddled middle of nothing happening and everyone frustrated. 
The other reason I like this idea is because you can immediately tell if someone is serious about a policy proposal because 
you can ask if they introduced it to the American Bundesrat. It is all fine and dandy to say you 
wish the federal government would X, but have you made a proposal to the American Bundesrat? 
</p>
<h4>Apportioning the House</h4> 
<p>Assuming we adopt proprotional representation, how should that be done? Usually there is an electroal threshold 
of 2% to 5%. I think the House should start with a threshold of 4% or 5% to prevent to much fragmentation. 
But then how do you allocate votes with each district or nationally? Generally, there is D'Hondt or Saint-Lague or 
largest remainder using droop or hare quota. Leveling seats. 
</p>
<h4>Expand the House</h4>
<p>
<a href="https://www.amacad.org/sites/default/files/publication/downloads/2021_Enlarging-the-House.pdf">Good case 
by Yuval Levin, Lee Drutman, Cohen, and Norm Ornstein
for enlarging the House to reorient the size with the trends before the House size was capped</a>, 
<a href="https://electionlawblog.org/?p=126244">Good point that it wouldnâ€™t cure gerrymandering</a>, 
but would make it less important and maybe harder. 
Here is a <a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/congressional-apportionment-amendment/">different case</a> 
arguing for massively expanding the house by Lyman Stone. Matthew Shugart 
<a href=" https://fruitsandvotes.wordpress.com/2021/01/19/emergency-electoral-reform-olpr-for-the-us-house/">argues 
for open lists as quick easy fix for the House, but prefers MMP coupled with a House expansion</a>.
The house should be expanded to approximately 693 seats based on the cube root law 
which says to take the cube root of the population to find out how many representatives to have. 
You could also set a limit between 250,000 to 500,000 and say there will be one representative for every X people. 
All of these should scale with future population increases and censuses. 
</p>
<h4>Fix the Senate to be truly representative of the states and to express states' power against the rest of the 
federal government</h4>
<p>Proposal to make the Senate a Bundesrat: chosen by state lower house majority. 
Minimum of two senators per state. Changes due to population take effect when the House sits after redistricting. 
Additional senators at for 1,2, 5 and every 10 million. Or just use the logarithmic formula. 
All senators from the same state must vote the same way.
Treaties still require senate approval as do constitutional amendments (confirmed by voting public). 
Also federal impeachments. Czechia requires that the senate approve electoral laws too. Every vote is majority. 
Only absolute majority for constitutional and presidential votes (for choosing president instead of electing president). 
We could do more of an Australian style upper house. Each state gets the same number of seats, is directly elected, 
territories get some representation, and uses some proportional representation method. 
I still prefer to keep the decreasingly proprotional system, like in Germany.  
Can also do reports, investigations, and introduce legislation. 
I just don't think there is much of an argument to keep the Senate wildly disproportional 
while its members are directly elected and the Senate has so much power. 
To weaken the Senate, give it the power to suspend legislation including budget and tax bills, requiring an 
absolut majority of members in the House to vote yes. 
Take away its powers for nominations and appointments. You could even go as far as the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_the_Czech_Republic">Czech Republic</a> and not allow 
the senate to vote on budgets, and its amendments or rejections of the lower house can be overtuned with an absolute majority, 
except for cases of treaties, constitutional amendments, and electoral laws, which sounds pretty good to me. 
</p>
<h4>Make the president weak again</h4>
<p>Weak president, in the 1990s most Senate democrats wanted to control use of force for Gulf War, not necessarily caring 
about if US went to war, but later they aquiesced 
to presidential dominance on military force questions, from Helen Thompson and Tom McTague on These Times. 
US president is too strong, <a href="https://secondratedemocracy.com/excessive-presidential-power/">part I</a>, 
<a href="https://www.vox.com/mischiefs-of-faction/2019/4/8/18300921/american-presidency-powers-in-context">part II</a>, 
<a href="https://www.bu.edu/law/journals-archive/bulr/documents/marshall.pdf">part III</a>, and 
<a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/529060-the-case-for-a-weaker-presidency/">part IV</a>.
<a href="https://protectdemocracy.org/work/case-multiparty-presidentialism/">Lee Drutman and Scott Mainwaring</a> 
on how a multiparty House is better than two party house, 
with spillovers into the presidency and senate, especially with no primaries. 
David Sligar once commented on twitter: why even have a head of state? Just give the prime minister or 
speaker of the legislature any roles necessary and make them accountable to parliament. My answer is to have the head of 
state chosen by parliament whether it be a governor-general or president. Or go full Switzerland and 
have a collective executive.
Interfluidity made a <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/04/24/two-kinds-of-representation/index.html">good 
distinction between a representative of all versus a representation of all</a>.
But why do we need one for all representation anyway? Just be Switzerland with a collective head of state
or choose a governor-general like former British colonies or some systems where the parliament chooses the president. 
</p>
<p>
France has a semi-presidential system. This is a weaker president, but not just ceremonial. 
The president appoints the prime minister, but the legislature can call a vote of no confidence. The president also 
calls elections and takes the lead on foreign policy and defense. 
</p>
<p>Austria, Costa Rica, France, Iceland, and Finland use the two round system to elect their presidents. Taiwan uses FPTP. 
Ireland uses ranked choice voting to elect its president. 
Greece and Malta have the parliament choose the president, and the president is very weak. 
Georgia, Germany, and Italy elect the president via special convention made of members of parliament and other 
government officials or people chosen by lower levels of government. 
The Swiss collective executive is a council of seven people chosen by all members of the parliament and 
they are voted on individually. The parties have agreed to the â€˜magic formulaâ€™, where the three "biggest" 
parties each get two people in the council, and the fourth "biggest" party gets the seventh seat. 
The chair of the council, or president, rotates every year. The president does not have special powers or authority. 
There is also a vice president who generally serves as the president for the following year. 
</p>
<p>President of Austria appoints and dismisses the cabinet, same for state governments and other officials, appoints judges, 
signs laws (but can refer them to the court for constitutionality), signs treaties, and has some emergency powers. 
President of France appoints the prime minister (but he or she can be dismissed by the National Assembly), calls 
elections, does many things related to foreign policy, including the military, has emergency powers, can grant pardons
has immunity while in office, and the president of the senate takes over 
if the president leaves office before the end of the term.
Governor-General in Canada just formally appoints people, gives royal assent to bills, calls elections, and a few other ceremonial things. They are chosen by the prime minister, although recently a committee or advisory group was used to inform the decision. 
The Governor-General in Australia has basically the same power as in Canada but seemingly more discretion? 
They also are nominated (appointed) by the prime minister. 
</p>
<h4>Politics of the Future, cathedral thinking, and demographics</h4>
Cathedral thinking (doing things for a future you will not live in) is underrated, see John Gray from Dublin.  
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/ie/podcast/in-praise-of-cathedral-thinking/id1462649946?i=1000597230506">podcast</a> 
that was the inspiration for this. David McWilliams talks about John Gray who built the water system in Dublin 
and massively improved public health in Dublin because of it. David McWilliams also mentions how the people building 
cathedrals in the middle ages and early modern period would start building cathedrals that they knew wouldn't 
finish in their lifetime, but for the glory of God and future generations they did it anyway. Also, planting 
oak trees for your grandkids or that you will never sit in the shade of. George Monbiot has written or talked 
about politics of the future too. All of this is running counter to democracies being increasingly dominated by old 
people, and this is more true of voters. Why no more great cathedrals? Or grand visions in general? 

<h4>Sortition and democracy</h4> 
<p>
citizen assembly with proposal option, referendums, constitutional changes, sortition, 
</p>

<h4>Bad assumptions</h4>
<p>US political system built on false assumptions including bargaining of legislators and no parties (Steve Teles).  
I think there could be a conspiracy about veto points and inequality, where the institutions of America are hard 
to change because any sensible change would almost certainly lead to more democratic outcomes that would redistribute
income and wealth. I am mainly thinking about proportional representation or parliamentarism being correlated 
with higher life expectancy more education and economic equality. Also stronger unions. 
Also, localism doesnâ€™t make sense with nationalized politics and political institutions, 
accountability is joke in highly polarized gerrymandered single member districts. 
The unrepresentativeness of senate and president block democratic outcomes very often.
At one point progressives thought electing separate officials at different times 
would be a check on corruption, but it turns out that now off cycle elections are bad because they are easily 
captured by special interests. And all the separate offices are hard to keep track of, and the obscure 
accountability. <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/filibuster">Matt Yglesias says the filibuster 
is bad for bargaining and compromise</a>.
The far right is rising everywhere, but electoral institutions are determining outcomes to a great extent. 
Also the far right is increasingly become so relevant that other parties are breaking the cordon sanitaire, 
for example in Germany (Mertz is signalling that maybe the AfD isn't so bad at the local level), 
Sweden (2022 election), Finland (2023 election where by the right wing coalition then broke its 
key campaign promise on debt), and of course Italy now has Meloni leading the right wing faction. 
Just want to point out that majoritarian voting systems empower the far right to take over the center right and 
thus gain outsized influence. Compare Marine Le Pen, 
Boris Johnson, Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro, Viktor OrbÃ¡n, and Recep Tayyip Erdo&#x011F;an
to AfD, Sweden Democrats, PVV, and New Zealand First.  
<a href="https://damonlinker.substack.com/p/what-just-happened-in-italy">Italy becoming more majoritarian</a>. 
<a href="https://democracyparadox.com/2022/08/16/kim-lane-scheppele-on-hungary-viktor-orban-and-its-democratic-decline/">Orban 
changing the electoral system (and other laws) to entrench his power</a>.
<a href="https://rulesofthegame.blog/turkeys-democratic-backsliding/">Erdogan also moving away from proportional 
representation and switching to presidential system to entrech his power</a>. 
<a href="https://www.fairvote.ca/factcheckextremists/">Here is a good explanation of how voting system 
affects whether far right gains power or not</a>, 
with similar levels of support across countries but with different voting system. 
Also small swings can make a huge impact in FPTP legislatures, especially with gerrymandering. 
Julia Azari puts all of these questions very well and points out the 
mismatches are making us unable to do stuff or make key reforms for the modern age</a>. 
</p>
<h4>Transparency</h4>
<h4>Parliamentary systems are better</h4>
<p>Tiago Ribeiro dos Santos on Why not parliamentarism? Parliamentarism passes 
<a href="https://whynotparliamentarism.com/f/how-parliamentarism-passes-the-pritchett-test">Pritchet test</a> and 
<a href="https://whynotparliamentarism.com/f/parliamentarism-passes-another-test">others</a>. US works because 
president it weak. Case of Chile. I laughed at Truss Kwamikaze and the head of lettuce, but I would vastly 
prefer their parliament over out congress and president. Can also dump unpopular party leaders, 
example Truss in 2022, Trump and Biden in 2020 onwards.
At a high level, US switch to a parliament would mean the House is much more important, 
and specifically the Speaker or Majority Leader.
Juan Linz on how presidencies concentrate power in executives over time. Presidencies tend to become autocracies.
Matt Yglesias makes the point that it is easier to resolve disputes between politicians and branches in 
parliamentary systems and that parliaments can get rid of bad (or unpopular) leaders. The option of changing 
leaders is good because cabinet or PM knows if they screw up, they are out. Presidents basically always get to finish 
terms unless they voluntarily leave or die. See how impeachment and removal is basically impossible in US now.  
Bayesian case for parliamentarism a la Tiago Ribeiro dos Santos.
Sam Hammond on how parliaments are more flexible which is good for rapid technological advancement. 
To be elected PM, you have to show you would be good at it and not a celebraty or non-politician just waltzing in. 
Which almost always means being in the parliament before you are given the top job. 
<a href="https://coryhaala.org/uncategorized/too-old-us-senate-1988-north-dakota-election-burdick-colonoscopy-handshake-strinden/">This 
is a crazy story</a> of an old senator from North Dakota who crushed his opponent and then died in office about 
four years later. The broader point I want to make here is that in parliamentary systems, this guy would 
get replaced by a co-partisan and all would be fine, rather than him trying to hang on in office. 
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/u33wp/is_it_true_that_democratization_has_proceeded/">Here</a> 
is a review of Mainwaring and Shugart saying presidentialism isn't a problem. They ignore the personalization 
of political parties, and I am not sure the flexibility or stability point really matters? Is 
Belgium worse than US for stability? I don't think so. </p>
<p>Also look at the countries the United States had a huge influence on those countries' consitutions. 
This includes Italy, Austria, Germany, Japan. (And Iraq? And Afghanistan?. Notice that Afghanistan had a strong president 
and it failed. Also notice that Iraq was mostly doing better but there problems are probably partly because 
of its demographics that make governing Iraq so hard.) Among the OECD countries there, notice only Austria 
elects its president directly and the Austrian president is quite weak. Japan is a constitutional monarchy, 
and Italy and Germany indirectly elect their president, both of whom have almost no power. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/mischiefs-of-faction/2019/4/11/18306412/constitution-executive-power-limits">Julia 
Azari says that the Constitution is unhelpful in constraining presidential power</a> and since the late 1800s, 
the president has become the central party politician, and now is the central figure in American politics. 
Julia Azari stumbling through 
<a href="https://gai.georgetown.edu/the-presidency-bending-institutions-to-save-them/">presidential power</a> 
and Trump vs Biden presidencies, specifically how they are viewed. Trump was chaotic and scandal ridden with no 
prior political experience. Joe Biden is exactly the oppposite and seems to get no credit for it, or at least
other things drown out what little credit he might get from that.
</p>
<p>As much disdain I have for the presidency being too powerful, the 
<a href="https://www.vox.com/mischiefs-of-faction/2019/4/9/18300749/senate-problem-electoral-college">Senate 
is probably worse</a>. The ways out of the Senate are harder. The options mentioned here are abolishing the 
filibuster, adding new states, amendments to strip the senate of power, or double amendments to make it more 
proportional or abolish the senate altogether. </p>
<p>I do want to put <a href="https://takecareblog.com/blog/congress-s-constitution-the-president-s-politics">some 
blame on congress</a>, who seems to have not taken its role as primary actor seriously and has let the executive 
and judiciary take power without complaint. Congress can do a lot with spending decisions and require the 
president and judiciary to do certain things and can always put forth amendments and make the case for them.
</p> 
<h4>Legislative procedures</h4>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riksdag">Swedish Riksdag</a>, constructive vote of no confidence, 
confidence of minister, speaker vs majority leader,
<A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Finland">Finnish Parliament</a> might be 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_Government">instructive</a>. 
<a href="https://leedrutman.substack.com/p/there-are-many-ways-to-organize-a">US house keeps changing its organization</a>, 
centralizing then decentralizing. Also discharge petitions used to be only a minority, then a majority, then they required 
public declaration that you signed the discharge petition. Very few laws have actually passed due to discharge petitions. 
Should probably concentrate power in the majority leaders hands and make the speaker the parliamentarian, more like 
how Sweden governs their Riksdag?
Suspensory veto, requiring absolute majority, Like Czechia Austria etc. 
Switzerland referendums as check on laws passed by parliament. 
Denmark requires a referendum if one third of Folketing wants one. 
Demissionary or acting cabinet. Calling early elections. 

</p>

<h4>Local government reforms</h4>
<p>
urbanism reform, regional or metropolitan governance, parliamentarism.
How to consolidate local governments and special districts? Especially look for previous examples
Do we need municipalities and counties and special districts? Seems like special districts should 
merge into cities or counties

<p>This page is how I would write a constitutional document for a country, especially the United States.
This mainly concerns elections, political actors, their responsibilities, and building in robustness and change.
Will also plan to add a section on why some reforms are needed today, post Covid. 
</p>
<h4>Base line reforms that are not partisan and would improve governance</h4>
<p>Off cycle elections are also bad, so the states that have state elections in odd years should move their elections 
by one year so they are at the same time as presidential or midterm elections. 
For pro federalism reasons, the federal government could be way more constructive by doing things 
with state heterogeneity in mind. This would take the form of more explicit state control, less constraining regulations and 
mandates, or lots of opt-outs or options built into laws, programs, and regulations. Also radically changing budgeting, 
which will be the focus later in this article. 
(Also, South Dakota v. Dole, which I think is wrong, not mention the SCOTUS cases over the ACA.)
</p>

<h4 id="fixingthehouse">Apportioning the House</h4> 
<h6>Fixing the House: proportional representation, apportionment, expand the House, end primaries, and fix redistricting 
</h6>
<p>**For the record basically any system is better than FPTP without primaries. 
It would be better to be like Canada, and even better to be Australia with AV. Or just straight up two rounds 
like in France. But if you switch to proportional then there is a decent case to use MMP like Germany, 
or STV like Ireland. But I prefer open lists with members chosen based purely on votes on each list 
because it is simple and give parties the least amount of power while retaining open lists.
<a href="https://www.voteguy.com/2024/07/02/clearing-up-misconceptions-about-open-list-pr/">Jack Santucci 
layed out clearly why open lists seem to be prefered</a>, and some of this I got from him.**
</p>
<p>Assuming we adopt proportional representation, how should that be done? 
How many constituencies and how people are elected from each? What, if any, are the leveling mechanisms? 
What is the electoral threshold for getting seats? STV, MMP, open lists, or closed lists? 
Usually there is an electoral threshold of 2% to 5%. I think the House 
should start with a threshold of 4% or 5% to prevent to much fragmentation. 
But then how do you allocate votes with each district or nationally? I think we should use open lists in the United States. 
This means that voters choose their favorite candidate from their favorite party, then seats are allocated first 
to each party, then to the candidates who received the most votes within each party (panachage). More about this later, 
but I think there should also be some kind of national leveling seats, especially because of how few representatives 
there can be in small states. 
Open lists are my favorite because everyone thinks in party membership anyway, and it allows very easy 
access to minority views via a new party and the threshold to entering the legislature is low that as long as 
about 3-5% back you, you get to have some input, and will likely force more negotiation because it is almost 
impossible for one party to win an outright majority.
Generally, there is d'Hondt or Sainte-Laguë, which are both largest remainder methods, to allocate seats to each party. 
D'Hondt method minimizes 'wasted' votes, and slightly favors larger parties 
or at least parties not splitting, while Sainte-Laguë is more proportional and favors smaller parties slightly. 
(Single transferable vote (STV) generally uses the Droop quota or using votes/(seats + 1). Hare quota is 
the more straight forward version of votes/seats. I would use the Droop quota if STV is used.)</p> 
<p>Leveling seats are fun. Spain, Italy, Sweden, Norway, and Finland all use different methods. Germany and UK examples 
of MMP are also different. First I want to distinguish between regional lists and with leveling seats and without.
Spain is a great example of what happens when you set a minimum of seats per district (each province is a district), 
with no national leveling seats. The quota used for determining seats isn't relevant here because of the 
strength of regionalist parties in Spain. The regionalist parties in Spain generally distort the 
percentage of vote compared to the percentage of seats. 
I think this is somewhat bad because the regionalist parties can get many seats, while broadly national parties with 
more votes get fewer seats, specifically the Canary Coalition, Vox, Ciudadanos, and other regional parties.
did a in a the two elections in 2019. Part of the disproportionality lies with the 
a minimum number of MPs for each district and wildly different populations in each district. 
Switzerland also has this system, 
but each canton is a district and they have a long history of the 'Magic Formula', so the 
disproportionality matters less anyway.
For contrast, Finland basically uses the same list system with regional districts but with much more equal districts, 
although they still don't have a perfect correlation between seats and votes, but there is a lower variance in 
the disparities than in Spain. 
Norway is a very interesting case of lists and leveling seats. Norway gives out 150 seats based on population and 
area, which does have a rural bias. Each district uses open lists, and then each district has an extra seat 
for purposes of leveling. This leveling does take national vote counts into equalization, but the members 
elected in these seats still come the county list in which they were a candidate. (My opinion is that should 
more directly allocate seats based purely on population or have even more leveling seats to get increased 
proportionality.) The Norway system strikes me as a very good option that the US could emulate, especially 
if the senate becomes more like the Canadian Senate (basically has no influence on legislation or any other powers).
</p> 
<p>
Now Sweden and Denmark. Both have districts, but also have leveling seats, so 
the allocation of seats is among the lowest of any system. Sweden has a threshold nationally to get leveling seats, 
or a threshhold a party has to reach in any one district. Denmark has 'nominating districts' and a 2% 
threshhold to get levling seats. If a party wins in a nominating district, they get the seat, but almost 
every party that meets the 2% also wins at least one nominating district. The leveling seats are then apportioned 
nationally. In Sweden they go through a few steps to get to the leveling seats, but basically it allocating seats 
in each district and then they use the national totals to allocate the additional leveling seats. 
(The Netherlands basically has a national list where you only need 1/150 or .667% of the national vote to get a seat. 
They use d'Hondt so it is not the most proportional but they already have so many parties.) 
Although, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_single_vote">this</a>, 
Denmark has single vote MMP with leveling seats, but it kind of functions like open lists. 
</p> 
<p>MMP mainly used in Germany and New Zealand and subnationally in the UK. Note that many large countries 
use MMP or its cousins parallel voting or MMM or AMS, like Japan, Germany, Italy, Scotland and Wales, South Korea, 
and Mexico.) The simple version is half the seats are FPTP, 
and the rest are allocated proportionally to the party vote. (Oh yeah, every voter gets a vote for the FPTP seat 
<i>and</i> a vote for their favorite party.) The FPTP vote doesn't have to be for the same party and the second vote. 
The party seats are basically list seats, except most people are on both, and the party leaders get the top places 
on the list. The trickiness comes when you get to all the party seats and you still have disproportionality. 
I don’t like MMP because of what happens in Germany where one party wins way more local seats than they get 
via proportional list seats. CDU/CSU wins almost all local seats such that they have to add MPs 
to maintain proportionality (more on that below). So either you aren’t proportional enough or you have to add MPs 
every once in a while. New Zealand doesn’t have this problem but they need to add more list seats in the future. 
It is much simpler than STV and is still much better than the current system in the US. 
You could get overhang seats, where a party won more FPTP seats than their party votes say they should have, 
for example the CDU in 2017. 
Germany also had case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_vote_weight">negative vote weight</a> 
where votes for the party list could help rather than hurt that party. In both these cases 
Germany used to just say <i>too bad</i>. Then the Federal Constitutional Court said, <i>no, you have to keep 
adding seats to be proportional</i> (now overhang seats and leveling seats). 
This started expanding the number of members in parliament, adding over 100 members a couple of times in a row. 
I think mostly for practical reasons, they changed this after the 2021 election. Germany basically switched 
to getting rid of local FPTP winners if the party doesn't reach the threshhold or there are overhang seats, 
in addition to expanding the number of seats to 630 (was 598 but was frequently more than 630 after the 
Federal Constitutional Court ruling and the law enacted because of it. Germany's high threshhold and the new system 
could lead to some chaos in Bavaria in the next federal election in Germany, which will be very interesting to watch. 
The UK subnational parliaments start the divisors with the number of FPTP seats they won and then add seats to each party 
until all the designated party seats are allocated, regardless of proportionality (no overhang seats). (Some countries use or 
have used MMP but they pick a member of the party they want to vote for, eliminating ticketsplitting.) 
When they have overhang seats, they just end up not getting any list seats and divide the list seats proportionally 
until they have no more list seats, even if it is unproportional. 
New Zealand takes a different approach where the parties keep the overhang seats, but they have 
a fixed number of list seats so it ends up being more proportional (overhang seats only.)
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additional-member_system">Following the examples here</a> 
MMP with overhang and leveling is better than no leveling, which is better than AMS, which is better than FPTP, 
(although, again, anything is better than FPTP). </p> 
<p>Italy's current electoral system is not great for it being a list system. The first election with 
the new system resulted in an outright majority for a party that only got low 40s percent of the vote. 
They used to use '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorporo"><i>scorporo</i></a>', which is 
a form of MMP, but the rules for the proportional list seats were badly written and ended up being gamed by the political 
parties.</p> 
<p>There is also a positive vote transfer system where the votes for losers and surplus votes from winners 
then go toward allocating seats in the party votes/seats (which was used in Romania for an election or two, 
and for local elections in Hungary).</p> 
<p> More fun with a proposed system in the UK called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_vote_plus">alternative 
vote plus</a>. The idea is to use the alternative vote, like the House of Representatives in Australia, 
and then have a second 'party vote' like in Germany.

<a href="https://www.newamerica.org/political-reform/reports/what-we-know-about-congressional-primaries-and-congressional-primary-reform">
primaries</a> are basically about weak parties and voters not being able to distinguish moderate and extreme candidates.  
I think it is also important to get rid of primaries (my preferred solution) or use AV instead of primaries and FPTP.  
All primaries for federal races should be on the same day so that better general election 
candidates win primaries, and that there is no distortion in presidential races due to staggered results. 
For example, I wanted to vote for Jay Inslee in the 2020 Democratic primary, but he had already dropped out, 
and it was already decided by the time I would have voted, and I didn’t even vote.

Redistricting in a comparative perspective: 
First of states should not unilaterally surrender on gerrymandering/redistricting. 
Colorado and Michigan seem to have the best <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redistricting_commission">redistricting 
commission</a>, or least the style of picking 
some Democrats, some Republicans, (probably copies California where it is actually largest and second 
largest party) and the rest being independents is the best way to go, along with having separate commissions 
for federal congressional districts and for state legislative districts. Michigan is good because 
there are more independents than either party individually. 
(Illinois has a <a href="https://redistricting.lls.edu/state/illinois/">backup commission</a>, 
which if the legislature and governor cannot make maps, 
and if still deadlocked, has the Illinois Supreme Court submit partisan nominees that are 
randomly chosen by the Secretary of State to break ties.

<h4 id="senate">Fix the Senate to be truly representative of the states and to express states' power against the rest of the 
federal government</h4>
<p>
Looking at other countries, I am surprised we don't have an instution where states can exert power 
within the federal government. Canada and Australia have councils of premiers where the premiers of each 
state/province and the prime minister/cabinet meet and work out agreements. Germany's Bundesrat or 'upper chamber' is composed 
of members chosen entirely by state cabinets and each state's members must exercise their power together, 
but also get no say over non-state affairs. 
Czech Senate must consent to treaties, electoral law and constitutional changes. 
Czech Senate also gets to confirm judges, not confidence in cabinet or ministers or budget and taxes. 
Elected by two rounds with one third elected every two years. 
Italy has perfect bicameralism including on confidence motions. It is dumb, do not copy. 
In the Netherlands, the upper chamber is chosen based on the provincial elections, but neither the chamber nor provinces 
are particularly important. Belgium also has its upper chamber based on regional elections (that occur at the same time as 
the national elections) and then those fifty senators choose another 10 senators. In the US, the closest we have to any of this is 
governors asking Congress or the executive branch nicely. Yes, the National Governor's association exists, but I can't tell 
if they have ever meaningfully done anything. In Australia, their council of state governments played a role in Covid policy.
In Canada, they have worked out numerous agreements over time and have even proposed amendments. In Germany they are constantly 
working to hammer out deals, including a major reform in the early 2000s, but also talking through tax changes occassionally 
(probably due to Germany's tax sharing system, but still, that is a major deal that states directly influence.) 
Which is to say I think this should be a major point of potential reform. 
So I think we need an 'American Bundesrat' modeled after Germany or Belgium. 
Even an informal organization, closer to Australia, 
would be great, because it would be very hard for the the rest of the American government, 
to ignore such an expression of states unified together saying the same thing. 
It seems like this could be a major way out of the muddled middle of nothing happening and everyone frustrated. 
The other reason I like this idea is because you can immediately tell if someone is serious about a policy proposal because 
you can ask if they introduced it to the American Bundesrat. It is all fine and dandy to say you 
wish the federal government would do X, but have you made a proposal to the American Bundesrat? 
</p>
<p>Proposal to make the Senate a Bundesrat: chosen by state lower house majority. 
Minimum of two senators per state. Changes due to population take effect when the House sits after redistricting. 
Additional senators at for 1,2, 5 and every 10 million. Or just use the logarithmic formula. 
All senators from the same state must vote the same way.
Treaties still require senate approval as do constitutional amendments (confirmed by voting public). 
Also federal impeachments. Czechia requires that the senate approve electoral laws too. Every vote is majority. 
Only absolute majority for constitutional and presidential votes (for choosing president instead of electing president). 
We could do more of an Australian style upper house. Each state gets the same number of seats, is directly elected, 
territories get some representation, and uses some proportional representation method. 
I still prefer to keep the decreasingly proprotional system, like in Germany.  
Can also do reports, investigations, and introduce legislation. 
I just don't think there is much of an argument to keep the Senate wildly disproportional 
while its members are directly elected and the Senate has so much power. 
If we cannot get structural reform, then the Senate should be stripped of its power via amendment. 
To weaken the Senate, give it the power to suspend legislation including budget and tax bills, requiring an 
absolute majority of members in the House to vote yes. Take away its role in confirming nominations. 
Take away its powers for nominations and appointments. You could even go as far as the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_the_Czech_Republic">Czech Republic</a> and not allow 
the senate to vote on budgets, and its amendments or rejections of the lower house can be overtuned with an absolute majority, 
except for cases of treaties, constitutional amendments, and electoral laws, which sounds pretty good to me. 
We could also do something like requiring the majority to represent at least half of the population 
(via the last census), kind of like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_majority#Switzerland">referendums 
in Switzerland with a double majority requirement</a>.

centrist national security people</a>, saying we have no idea what the president is not immune from,
and it is crazy that so much would be immune. Biden, to his credit will not take advantage of the now 
extensive immunity or apparent immunity given by SCOTUS. Although, I wonder if he should do the most 
minor thing that is clearly crazy a president can get away, just to push the point and urge Congress to do something. 
Or the people to do an amendment again.
<p>There was a weaker president, such as in the 1990s most Senate democrats wanted to control use of force 
for Gulf War, not necessarily caring about if US went to war, but later they aquiesced 
to presidential dominance on military force questions, from Helen Thompson and Tom McTague on These Times.

David Sligar once commented on twitter: why even have a head of state? Just give the prime minister or 
speaker of the legislature any roles necessary and make them accountable to parliament. My answer is to have the head of 
state chosen by parliament whether it be a governor-general or president. Or go full Switzerland and 
have a collective executive. 
Interfluidity made a <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/04/24/two-kinds-of-representation/index.html">good 
distinction between a representative of all versus a representation of all</a>.
But why do we need one for all representation anyway? Just be Switzerland with a collective head of state
or choose a governor-general like former British colonies or some systems where the parliament chooses the president. 

</p>
France has a semi-presidential system. This is a weaker president, but not just ceremonial. 
The president appoints the prime minister (but the prime minister can be dismissed by the National Assembly), 
calls elections, does many things related to foreign policy, including the military, has emergency powers, 
can grant pardons, and has immunity while in office. 
</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Austria">President of Austria</a> appoints and 
dismisses the cabinet, same for state governments and other officials, appoints judges, 
signs laws (but can refer them to the court for constitutionality), signs treaties, and has some emergency powers. 
The president can also call elections unilaterally. 
</p>
<p>The President of Bulgaria has a few weird powers, like being able to give or revoke citizenship and refugee status 
and rename cities, but has the normal powers of appointing 
prime minister and other officials, can pardon people, temporarily veto laws, 
emergency powers, calls elections, and gives awards.
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Czech_Republic">President of the Czech Republic</a> 
can veto laws but can be overridden by absolute majority of members, 
calls elections, immunity, and ceremonial powers. They require a minimum number of signatures to run 
or the support of a minimum number of senators or deputies. 
</p>
<p>The Icelandic president is weak. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Iceland">president</a> 
can do normal appointing the cabinet and other officials and dissolving of parliament, can submit bills to parliament, 
can reject a bill which is then submitted to a referendum by the public, some emergency powers, and 
can grant pardons and amnesty. If the president cannot do his duty or leaves office early, the head of the legislature, 
Supreme Court, and the prime minister collectively share the role. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Finland">Finland has a weak president too</a>. 
The president makes appointments, is the commander in chief has emergency powers, and can do one-off pardons. 
Of course, he or she also appoints the prime minister and cabinet. The president can veto or wait out a bill, 
but generally doesn't.The president algo grants awards, honors, and medals.
</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Greece">President of Greece</a> is basically ceremonial.
Ireland also has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ireland">ceremonial weak president</a>, 
but has a lot of symbolic roles.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Estonia">President of Estonia</a> is quite weak 
and only seems to do the things a constiutial monarch would. The president of Estonia can make 
proposals for amendments, laws, and emergency powers/martial law to the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riigikogu">Riigikogu</a> (Estonian Parliament). 
</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Latvia">President of Latvia</a> is similar 
to Estonia but has slightly more power. The president of Estonia is explicilty not the chief executive, 
even in name only.
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeima#Elections">President 
of Latvia</a> loses his job if he calls for an election and the people reject it in a referendum. 
</p>
<p>(Taiwan uses FPTP to elect its president.) 
Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic,  Finland, France, and Iceland use the two round system to elect their presidents. 
Ireland uses ranked choice voting to elect its president. 
Estonia, Greece, and Latvia have the parliament choose the president, and the president is very weak. 
Georgia, Germany, and Italy elect the president via special convention made of members of parliament and other 
government officials or people chosen by lower levels of government. 
</p>
<p>If the president leaves office before the end of the term, the and the president of the senate takes over 
in France, and Germany. In Austria, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Austria">trio 
from the lower house</a> takes over until a new president it elected.  
</p>
<p>The Swiss collective executive is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Council_(Switzerland)">council 
of seven people chosen by all members of the parliament and 
they are voted on individually</a>. The parties have agreed to the ‘magic formula’, where the three "biggest" 
parties each get two people in the council, and the fourth "biggest" party gets the seventh seat. 
The chair of the council, or president, rotates every year. The president does not have special powers or authority. 
There is also a vice president who generally serves as the president for the following year. 
</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Germany">President of Germany</a> can 
do the same appointments, calling of elections, veto bills (though very rarely and only because 
the president believed it was unconstitutional or required the Bundesrat to approve it), signs all bills, 
awards, individual pardons, and some emergency powers. 
</p>
<p>In Italy, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Italy">president</a> can appoint senators for life,  
approve laws or send it to parliament for reconsideration, call referendums, appointing the prime minister, cabinet, 
and other officials, emergency powers, can dissolve regional governments and legislatures, immunity 
for most crimes, granting pardons and commutations, and granting honors and awards. </p>
<p>Side note, the Governors-General of former UK colonies all basically do nothing. I want to highlight 
Canada and Australia because they are federal countries like the United States. 
The Governor-General in Canada just formally appoints people, gives royal assent to bills, calls elections, 
and a few other ceremonial things. They are chosen by the prime minister, although recently a committee 
or advisory group was used to inform the decision more recently. 
The Governor-General in Australia has basically the same power as in Canada but seemingly has more discretion? 
They also are nominated (appointed) by the prime minister. 
</p>
<p>In a unicameral system I think proposing laws works. In a bicameral system with different constituencies 
or electoral systems in each house, it seems better not allow the president to propose laws. 
Calling elections unilaterally seems bad except after a period of impasse. Otherwise just have it done after 
a given amount of time or with the prime minister asking for them. Veto should be removed, 
especially in bicameral systems. Immunity shouldn’t exist, but if it does, statute of limitations is suspended 
while in office and they are definitely not immune out of office. 
I think it is probably a good idea to let the president refer laws to courts or in some way challenge 
constitutionality, again, less necessary for bicameral legislatures. Vetoes are tricky, but probably shouldn’t be allowed. 
The Bulgarian and Italian way of a veto sending the bill back to parliament for reconsideration I think is good. 
Decrees and executive orders should be done by the prime minister or congress, not the president. There may be 
something where it must be the president but should be as minimal as possible. Declaring a state of emergency 
is probably okay if the cabinet (parliamentary cabinet) must agree, but should not give the president any 
extra power without congressional or parliamentary power that can be revoked at any time. 
As far as term limits go, usually a president has up to two terms, but sometimes one like in Mexico. 
There are a few weak presidents that can serve many terms. Some countries don't allow consecutive terms. 
Overall, I think the stronger the president is, the less terms they should have. 
(By the way, there is a paper by Cheibub saying that presdientialism works well when the president always fears he or she 
might not be reelected. We obvious are not following the implications of that.)
Term length is usually four, five or six years. Again, the weaker the president, the less this matters. I prefer four 
or five years, especially if the legislature is elected every four or five years and is mostly coincident with 
presidential terms.  
Maybe the president should not be able to hold any other office afterward leaving the presidency? Not 
even state or local offices. Just give them a very cushy pension.
</p>
<p>So given all of these examples, I think there are a few viable and preferred changes the US could or should make. 
The first thing would probably be to change the presdiential veto to a suspensory veto, or have to provide a reason 
why it is unconstitutional. Basically congress has final say on legislation with a pure absolute majority of 
members voting yes on a law. Get rid of presidential primariesThe next thing is to change the election 
of the president. It would be best to 
not directly elect the president. I think something like Germany's convention of states choosing members, 
and the members of both houses, and then they just vote a few times until they get a majority. 
This seems really good and seems likely to elect moderate, competent, and uncorrupt elder statesmen. 
If there must be direct election, obvious ranked choice would be the best but seems highly impractical, 
so two-round system it is. The next thing is to make it easier to remove a corrupt, treasonous, or otherwise 
uncapable president. I think a three fifths of both houses of congress together should be sufficient to 
remove a president. Then the presidential powers that are necessary to be done can be fulfilled by the majority and 
minority leader of the Senate and someone the speaker names who has served at least six years in the senate, or less 
with an absolute majority of senators agreeing. Lastly remove presidential power such that the prime minister 
is the executive and president is not the executive or commander in chief like Estonia. The president should also 
be able to do one-off pardons, amnesty, and commutations, but not mass pardons or amnesty or commutations. 
Alexander Hamilton thought a pardon could be used as a military thing to stop rebellions. 
George Mason thought it made the president too powerful. It has gotten especially powerful and less common 
since Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon. 
I think the pardon is fine, but there should probably limits to pardoning ones self and people closest to the president 
and vice president and the cabinet. No mass pardons, no amnesty. Spain seems to have a good model of how to do pardons, 
based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon#Spain">Wikipedia</a>. 
The president can only do nominations and and appointments with consent of prime minister or cabinet. 
</p>
<p>If and only if the president is directly elected in two round or with alternative vote should the president be able to 
propose laws to parliament. Also, if and only if directly elected the president should have to get support of 
at least ten percent of current legislators, rounded up (501 legislaters means 51 must publically back you). 
</p>
<p>One last oddball idea is to have a joint legislature use STV to elect all members of 
a collective executive like in Swizterland where the memebers collectively decide on all actions. 
of the collective executive. 
</p>
<h4>Politics of the Future, cathedral thinking, and demographics</h4>
<p>Cathedral thinking (doing things for a future you will not live in) is underrated, see John Gray from Dublin. This 
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/ie/podcast/in-praise-of-cathedral-thinking/id1462649946?i=1000597230506">podcast</a> 
was the inspiration for this. David McWilliams talks about John Gray who built the water system in Dublin 
and massively improved public health in Dublin because of it. David McWilliams also mentions how the people building 
cathedrals in the middle ages and early modern period would start building cathedrals that they knew wouldn't 
finish in their lifetime, but for the glory of God and future generations they did it anyway. Also, planting 
oak trees for your grandkids or that you will never sit in the shade of. George Monbiot has written or talked 
about politics of the future too. All of this is running counter to democracies being increasingly dominated by old 
people, and this is more true of voters. Why no more great cathedrals? Or grand visions in general? 
</p> 
<h4>Sortition and democracy</h4> 
<p>
citizen assembly with proposal option, referendums, constitutional changes, sortition, 
</p>

<h4>Bad assumptions</h4>
<p>US political system built on false assumptions including bargaining of legislators and no parties (Steve Teles).  
I think there could be a conspiracy about veto points and inequality, where the institutions of America are hard 
to change because any sensible change would almost certainly lead to more democratic outcomes that would redistribute
income and wealth. I am mainly thinking about proportional representation or parliamentarism being correlated 
with higher life expectancy more education and economic equality. Also stronger unions. 
Also, localism doesn’t make sense with nationalized politics and political institutions, 
accountability is joke in highly polarized gerrymandered single member districts. 
The unrepresentativeness of senate and president block democratic outcomes very often.
At one point progressives thought electing separate officials at different times 
would be a check on corruption, but it turns out that now off cycle elections are bad because they are easily 
captured by special interests. And all the separate offices are hard to keep track of, and the obscure 
accountability. <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/filibuster">Matt Yglesias says the filibuster 
is bad for bargaining and compromise</a>.
The far right is rising everywhere, but electoral institutions are determining outcomes to a great extent. 
Also the far right is increasingly become so relevant that other parties are breaking the cordon sanitaire, 
for example in Germany (Mertz is signalling that maybe the AfD isn't so bad at the local level), 
Sweden (2022 election), Finland (2023 election where by the right wing coalition then broke its 
key campaign promise on debt), and of course Italy now has Meloni leading the right wing faction. 
Just want to point out that majoritarian voting systems empower the far right to take over the center right and 
thus gain outsized influence. Compare Marine Le Pen, 
Boris Johnson, Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro, Viktor Orbán, and Recep Tayyip Erdo&#x011F;an
to AfD, Sweden Democrats, PVV, and New Zealand First.

<a href="https://www.fairvote.ca/factcheckextremists/">Here is a good explanation of how voting system 
affects whether far right gains power or not</a>, 
with similar levels of support across countries but with different voting system. 
Also small swings can make a huge impact in FPTP legislatures, especially with gerrymandering. 
Julia Azari puts all of these questions very well and points out the 
mismatches are making us unable to do stuff or make key reforms for the modern age</a>.

<a href="https://whynotparliamentarism.com/f/how-parliamentarism-passes-the-pritchett-test">Pritchet test</a> and 
<a href="https://whynotparliamentarism.com/f/parliamentarism-passes-another-test">others</a>. US works because 
president it weak. Case of Chile. I laughed at Truss and "Kwamikaze" and the head of lettuce, but I would vastly 
prefer their parliament over out congress and president. Can also dump unpopular party leaders, 
example Truss in 2022, Trump and Biden in 2020 onwards. Or France since 2017 or so. 
At a high level, US switch to a parliament would mean the House is much more important, 
and specifically the Speaker or Majority Leader.
Juan Linz on how presidencies concentrate power in executives over time. Presidencies tend to become autocracies.
This seems to be because of term limits. 
<a href="https://adambrown.info/p/notes/cheibub_presidentialism_and_democratic_performance">Cheibub 2002</a> 
seems to say that high popularity and term limits makes a president 
think he or she can get away with staying in office after the term expires. With divided government, 
it seems to help a president. The president is also likely to get support from other parties, 
or resort to extra-constitutional means to get a legislature favorable to the president's agenda.
Matt Yglesias makes the point that it is easier to resolve disputes between politicians and branches in 
parliamentary systems and that parliaments can get rid of bad (or unpopular) leaders. The option of changing 
leaders is good because cabinet or PM knows if they screw up, they are out. Presidents basically always get to finish 
terms unless they voluntarily leave or die. See how impeachment and removal is basically impossible in US now.  
Bayesian case for parliamentarism a la Tiago Ribeiro dos Santos.
Sam Hammond on how parliaments are more flexible which is good for rapid technological advancement. 
To be elected PM, you have to show you would be good at it and not a celebraty or non-politician just waltzing in. 
Which almost always means being in the parliament before you are given the top job.

slow autocratization, but also make it harder to reverse if illiberal parties gain power:

<p>Also look at the countries the United States had a huge influence on those countries' constitutions. 
This includes Italy, Austria, Germany, Japan. (And Iraq? And Afghanistan?. Notice that Afghanistan had a strong president 
and it failed. Also notice that Iraq was mostly doing better but there problems are probably partly because 
of its demographics that make governing Iraq so hard.) Among the OECD countries there, notice only Austria 
elects its president directly and the Austrian president is quite weak. Japan is a constitutional monarchy, 
and Italy and Germany indirectly elect their president, both of whom have almost no power. </p>

<p>As much disdain I have for the presidency being too powerful, the 
<a href="https://www.vox.com/mischiefs-of-faction/2019/4/9/18300749/senate-problem-electoral-college">Senate 
is probably worse</a>. The ways out of the Senate are harder. The options mentioned here are abolishing the 
filibuster, adding new states, amendments to strip the senate of power, or double amendments to make it more 
proportional or abolish the senate altogether. Senate is bad, mainly because it is so powerful and 
unrepresentative: https://secondratedemocracy.com/unrepresentative-senate/ 
</p>
<p>I do want to put <a href="https://takecareblog.com/blog/congress-s-constitution-the-president-s-politics">some 
blame on congress</a>, who seems to have not taken its role as primary actor seriously and has let the executive 
and judiciary take power without complaint. Congress can do a lot with spending decisions and require the 
president and judiciary to do certain things and can always put forth amendments and make the case for them.
</p> 

<h4>Legislative procedures</h4>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riksdag">Swedish Riksdag</a>, constructive vote of no confidence, 
confidence of minister, speaker vs majority leader,
<A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Finland">Finnish Parliament</a> might be

<a href="https://leedrutman.substack.com/p/there-are-many-ways-to-organize-a">US house keeps changing its organization</a>, 
centralizing then decentralizing. Also discharge petitions used to be only a minority, then a majority, then they required 
public declaration that you signed the discharge petition. Very few laws have actually passed due to discharge petitions. 
Should probably concentrate power in the majority leaders hands and make the speaker the parliamentarian, more like 
how Sweden governs their Riksdag?
Suspensory veto, requiring absolute majority, Like Czechia Austria etc. 
Switzerland referendums as check on laws passed by parliament. 
Denmark requires a referendum if one third of Folketing wants one. 
Demissionary or acting cabinet. Calling early elections.

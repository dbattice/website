<p id="p0">
This is politics, to the extent people disagree about how the government should be structured. 
Here is a footnote.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footer1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> 
And another.<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footer1" id="ref2">2</a></sup>
</p>
<p>This page is how I would write a constitutional document for a country, especially the United States.
This mainly concerns elections, political actors, their responsibilities, and building in robustness and change.
Will also plan to add a section on why some reforms are needed today, post Covid. 
</p>
<h4>Expand the House</h4>
<p>
<a href="https://www.amacad.org/sites/default/files/publication/downloads/2021_Enlarging-the-House.pdf">Good case 
for enlarging the House to reorient the size with the trends before the House size was capped</a>, 
by Yuval Levin, Lee Drutman, Cohen, and Norm Ornstein.
<a href="https://electionlawblog.org/?p=126244">Good point that it wouldn’t cure gerrymandering</a>, 
but would make it less important and maybe harder. 
Here is a <a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/congressional-apportionment-amendment/">different case</a> 
arguing for massively expanding the house by Lyman Stone. 
The house should be expanded to approximately 693 seats based on the cube root law 
which says to take the cube root of the population to find out how many representatives to have. 
You could also set a limit between 250,000 to 500,000 and say there will be one representative for every X people. 
All of these should scale with future population increases and censuses. 
</p>
<h4>Fix the Senate to be truly representative of the states and to express states' power against the rest of the 
federal government</h4>
<p>Proposal to make the Senate a Bundesrat: chosen by state lower house majority. 
Minimum 2 senators. Changes due to population take effect when the House sits after redistricting. 
Additional senators at for 1,2, 5 and every 10 million. 
All senators from the same state must vote the same way. Senate can only suspend legislation including budget and tax bills. 
Treaties still require senate approval as do constitutional amendments (confirmed by voting public). 
Also federal impeachments. Every vote is majority. 
Only absolute majority for constitutional and presidential votes (for choosing president instead of electing president). 
Basically France, Czechia, or Austria powers, with Germany inspired members and procedures. 
Can also do reports, investigations, and introduce legislation. 
Not much of an argument to keep the Senate wildly disproportional while its members are directly elected. 
Have a constitutional amendment clarifying federal relations. 
</p>
<h6>Make the president weak again</h6>
<p>Weak president, in the 1990s most Senate democrats wanted to control use of force for Gulf War, not necessarily caring 
about if US went to war, but later they aquiesced 
to presidential dominance on military force questions, from Helen Thompson and Tom McTague on These Times. 
</p>
<p>
US president is too strong, <a href="https://secondratedemocracy.com/excessive-presidential-power/">part I</a>, 
<a href="https://www.vox.com/mischiefs-of-faction/2019/4/8/18300921/american-presidency-powers-in-context">part II</a>, 
<a href="https://www.bu.edu/law/journals-archive/bulr/documents/marshall.pdf">part III</a>, and 
<a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/529060-the-case-for-a-weaker-presidency/">part IV</a>.
<a href="https://protectdemocracy.org/work/case-multiparty-presidentialism/">Lee Drutman and Scott Mainwaring</a> 
on how a multiparty House is better than two party house, 
with spillovers into the presidency and senate, especially with no primaries. 
</p>
<h4>Politics of the Future, cathedral thinking, and demographics</h4>
Cathedral thinking 
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/ie/podcast/in-praise-of-cathedral-thinking/id1462649946?i=1000597230506">podcast</a> 
that was the inspiration for this. David McWilliams talks about John Gray who built the water system in Dublin 
and massively improved public health in Dublin because of it. David McWilliams also mentions how the people building 
cathedrals in the middle ages and early modern period would start building cathedrals that they knew wouldn't 
finish in their lifetime, but for the glory of God and future generations they did it anyway. Also, planting 
oak trees for your grandkids or that you will never sit in the shade of. George Monbiot has written or talked 
about politics of the future too. All of this is running counter to democracies being increasingly dominated by old 
people, and this is more true of voters. George Monbiot too. 
<h4>Sortition and democracy</h4> 
<p>
State reform: unicameral proportional parliament, 
urbanism reform, citizen assembly with proposal option, 
health reform, federalism reform.
</p>

<h6>Bad assumptions</h6>
<p>US political system built on false assumptions including bargaining of legislators and no parties (Steve Teles), 
conspiracy about veto points and inequality, proportional representation or parliamentarism is correlated 
with higher life expectancy more education and economic equality, 
localism doesn’t make sense with nationalized politics and political institutions, 
accountability is joke in highly polarized gerrymandered single member districts, 
unrepresentativeness of senate and president, off cycle elections are bad,
Elections, constitutional structure, democracy, referendums 
(basically, far right is rising everywhere, but electoral institutions are determining outcomes to a great extent);
<a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/filibuster">Matt Yglesias says the filibuster 
is bad for bargaining and compromise</a>.

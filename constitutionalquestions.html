This is politics, to the extent people disagree about how the government should be structured. 
Here is a footnote.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footer1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> 
And another.<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footer1" id="ref2">2</a></sup>
</p>
<p>This page is how I would write a constitutional document for a country, especially the United States.
This mainly concerns elections, political actors, their responsibilities, and building in robustness and change.
Will also plan to add a section on why some reforms are needed today, post Covid. 
</p>
<h6>Base line reforms that are not partisan and would improve governance</h6>
<p>Off cycle elections are also bad, so the states that have state elections in odd years should move their elections 
by one year so they are at the same time as presidential or midterm elections. 
For pro federalism reasons, the federal government could be way more constructive by doing things 
with state heterogeneity in mind. This would take the form of more explicit state control, less constraining regulations and 
mandates, or lots of opt-outs or options built into laws, programs, and regulations. Also radically changing budgeting, 
which will be the focus later in this article. 
(Also, South Dakota v. Dole, which I think is wrong, not mention the SCOTUS cases over the ACA.)
</p>
<p>
Looking at other countries, I am surprised we don't have an instution where states can exert power 
within the federal government. Canada and Australia have councils of premiers where the premiers of each 
state/province and the prime minister/cabinet meet and work out agreements. Germany's Bundesrat or 'upper chamber' is composed 
of members chosen entirely by state cabinets and each state's members must exercise their power together, 
but also get no say over non-state affairs. 
In the Netherlands, the upper chamber is chosen based on the provincial elections, but neither the chamber nor provinces 
are particularly important. Belgium also has its upper chamber based on regional elections (that occur at the same time as 
the national elections) and then those fifty senators choose another 10 senators. In the US, the closest we have to any of this is 
governors asking Congress or the executive branch nicely. Yes, the National Governor's association exists, but I can't tell 
if they have ever meaningfully done anything. In Australia, their council of state governments played a role in Covid policy.
In Canada, they have worked out numerous agreements over time and have even proposed amendments. In Germany they are constantly 
working to hammer out deals, including a major reform in the early 2000s, but also talking through tax changes occassionally 
(probably due to Germany's tax sharing system, but still, that is a major deal that states directly influence.) 
Which is to say I think this should be a major point of potential reform. 
So I think we need an 'American Bundesrat' modeled after Germany or Belgium. 
Even an informal organization, closer to Australia, 
would be great, because it would be very hard for the American Bundesrat 
to ignore all states unified together saying the same thing. 
It seems like this could be a major way out of the muddled middle of nothing happening and everyone frustrated. 
The other reason I like this idea is because you can immediately tell if someone is serious about a policy proposal because 
you can ask if they introduced it to the American Bundesrat. It is all fine and dandy to say you 
wish the federal government would X, but have you made a proposal to the American Bundesrat? 
</p>
<h6>Apportioning the House</h6> 
<p>Assuming we adopt proprotional representation, how should that be done? Usually there is an electroal threshold 
of 2% to 5%. I think the House should start with a threshold of 4% or 5% to prevent to much fragmentation. 
But then how do you allocate votes with each district or nationally? Generally, there is D'Hondt or Saint-Lague or 
largest remainder using droop or hare quota. Leveling seats. 
</p>
<h4>Expand the House</h4>
<p>
<a href="https://www.amacad.org/sites/default/files/publication/downloads/2021_Enlarging-the-House.pdf">Good case 
by Yuval Levin, Lee Drutman, Cohen, and Norm Ornstein
for enlarging the House to reorient the size with the trends before the House size was capped</a>, 
<a href="https://electionlawblog.org/?p=126244">Good point that it wouldn’t cure gerrymandering</a>, 
but would make it less important and maybe harder. 
Here is a <a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/congressional-apportionment-amendment/">different case</a> 
arguing for massively expanding the house by Lyman Stone. Matthew Shugart 
<a href=" https://fruitsandvotes.wordpress.com/2021/01/19/emergency-electoral-reform-olpr-for-the-us-house/">argues 
for open lists as quick easy fix for the House, but prefers MMP coupled with a House expansion</a>.
The house should be expanded to approximately 693 seats based on the cube root law 
which says to take the cube root of the population to find out how many representatives to have. 
You could also set a limit between 250,000 to 500,000 and say there will be one representative for every X people. 
All of these should scale with future population increases and censuses. 
</p>
<h4>Fix the Senate to be truly representative of the states and to express states' power against the rest of the 
federal government</h4>
<p>Proposal to make the Senate a Bundesrat: chosen by state lower house majority. 
Minimum of two senators per state. Changes due to population take effect when the House sits after redistricting. 
Additional senators at for 1,2, 5 and every 10 million. Or just use the logarithmic formula. 
All senators from the same state must vote the same way.
Treaties still require senate approval as do constitutional amendments (confirmed by voting public). 
Also federal impeachments. Czechia requires that the senate approve electoral laws too. Every vote is majority. 
Only absolute majority for constitutional and presidential votes (for choosing president instead of electing president). 
We could do more of an Australian style upper house. Each state gets the same number of seats, is directly elected, 
territories get some representation, and uses some proportional representation method. 
I still prefer to keep the decreasingly proprotional system, like in Germany.  
Can also do reports, investigations, and introduce legislation. 
I just don't think there is much of an argument to keep the Senate wildly disproportional 
while its members are directly elected and the Senate has so much power. 
To weaken the Senate, give it the power to suspend legislation including budget and tax bills, requiring an 
absolut majority of members in the House to vote yes. 
Take away its powers for nominations and appointments. You could even go as far as the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_the_Czech_Republic">Czech Republic</a> and not allow 
the senate to vote on budgets, and its amendments or rejections of the lower house can be overtuned with an absolute majority, 
except for cases of treaties, constitutional amendments, and electoral laws, which sounds pretty good to me. 
</p>
<h6>Make the president weak again</h6>
<p>Weak president, in the 1990s most Senate democrats wanted to control use of force for Gulf War, not necessarily caring 
about if US went to war, but later they aquiesced 
to presidential dominance on military force questions, from Helen Thompson and Tom McTague on These Times. 
US president is too strong, <a href="https://secondratedemocracy.com/excessive-presidential-power/">part I</a>,

<a href="https://protectdemocracy.org/work/case-multiparty-presidentialism/">Lee Drutman and Scott Mainwaring</a> 
on how a multiparty House is better than two party house, 
with spillovers into the presidency and senate, especially with no primaries. 
David Sligar once commented on twitter: why even have a head of state? Just give the prime minister or 
speaker of the legislature any roles necessary and make them accountable to parliament. My answer is to have the head of 
state chosen by parliament whether it be a governor-general or president. Or go full Switzerland and 
have a collective executive.
Interfluidity made a <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/04/24/two-kinds-of-representation/index.html">good 
distinction between a representative of all versus a representation of all</a>.
But why do we need one for all representation anyway? Just be Switzerland with a collective head of state
or choose a governor-general like former British colonies or some systems where the parliament chooses the president. 
</p>
<p>
France has semi-presidential systems. This is a weaker president, but not just ceremonial. 
The president appoints the prime minister, but the legislature can call a vote of no confidence. The president also 
calls elections and takes the lead on foreign policy and defense. 
</p>
<p>Austria, Costa Rica, France, Iceland, and Finland use the two round system to elect their presidents. Taiwan uses FPTP. 
Ireland uses ranked choice voting to elect its president. 
Greece and Malta have the parliament choose the president, and the president is very weak. 
Georgia, Germany, and Italy elect the president via special convention made of members of parliament and other 
government officials or people chosen by lower levels of government. 
The Swiss collective executive is a council of seven people chosen by all members of the parliament and 
they are voted on individually. The parties have agreed to the ‘magic formula’, where the three "biggest" 
parties each get two people in the council, and the fourth "biggest" party gets the seventh seat. 
The chair of the council, or president, rotates every year. The president does not have special powers or authority. 
There is also a vice president who generally serves as the president for the following year. 
</p>
<p>President of Austria appoints and dismisses the cabinet, same for state governments and other officials, appoints judges, 
signs laws (but can refer them to the court for constitutionality), signs treaties, and has some emergency powers. 
President of France appoints the prime minister (but he or she can be dismissed by the National Assembly), calls 
elections, does many things related to foreign policy, including the military, has emergency powers, can grant pardons
has immunity while in office, and the president of the senate takes over 
if the president leaves office before the end of the term.
Governor-General in Canada just formally appoints people, gives royal assent to bills, calls elections, and a few other ceremonial things. They are chosen by the prime minister, although recently a committee or advisory group was used to inform the decision. 
The Governor-General in Australia has basically the same power as in Canada but seemingly more discretion? 
They also are nominated (appointed) by the prime minister.

<h4>Politics of the Future, cathedral thinking, and demographics</h4>
Cathedral thinking 
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/ie/podcast/in-praise-of-cathedral-thinking/id1462649946?i=1000597230506">podcast</a> 
that was the inspiration for this. David McWilliams talks about John Gray who built the water system in Dublin 
and massively improved public health in Dublin because of it. David McWilliams also mentions how the people building 
cathedrals in the middle ages and early modern period would start building cathedrals that they knew wouldn't 
finish in their lifetime, but for the glory of God and future generations they did it anyway. Also, planting 
oak trees for your grandkids or that you will never sit in the shade of. George Monbiot has written or talked 
about politics of the future too. All of this is running counter to democracies being increasingly dominated by old 
people, and this is more true of voters. 
<h4>Sortition and democracy</h4> 
<p>
State reform: unicameral proportional parliament, 
urbanism reform, citizen assembly with proposal option, 
health reform, federalism reform.
</p>

<h6>Bad assumptions</h6>
<p>US political system built on false assumptions including bargaining of legislators and no parties (Steve Teles), 
conspiracy about veto points and inequality, proportional representation or parliamentarism is correlated 
with higher life expectancy more education and economic equality, 
localism doesn’t make sense with nationalized politics and political institutions, 
accountability is joke in highly polarized gerrymandered single member districts, 
unrepresentativeness of senate and president, off cycle elections are bad. 
<a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/filibuster">Matt Yglesias says the filibuster 
is bad for bargaining and compromise</a>.
The far right is rising everywhere, but electoral institutions are determining outcomes to a great extent. 
Also the far right is increasingly become so relevant that other parties are breaking the cordon sanitaire, 
for example in Germany, Sweden, Finland, and of course Italy now has Meloni. 
Just want to point out that majoritarian voting systems empower the far right to take over the center right and thus gain outsized influence. Compare Le Pen Boris Johnson Trump Bolsonaro Orban Erdogan to AfD Sweden Democrats PVV and New Zealand: https://www.fairvote.ca/factcheckextremists/
<a href="https://damonlinker.substack.com/p/what-just-happened-in-italy">Italy becoming more majoritarian</a>. 
<a href="https://democracyparadox.com/2022/08/16/kim-lane-scheppele-on-hungary-viktor-orban-and-its-democratic-decline/">Orban 
changing the electoral system (and other laws) to entrench his power</a>.
<a href="https://rulesofthegame.blog/turkeys-democratic-backsliding/">Erdogan also moving away from proportional 
representation and switching to presidential system to entrech his power</a>. 
<a href="https://www.fairvote.ca/factcheckextremists/">Here is a good explanation of how voting system 
affects whether far right gains power or not, 
with similar levels of support across countries but with different voting system: 
Also small swings can make a huge impact in FPTP legislatures, especially with gerrymandering.

Unemployment is underrated by politics (Kornai, millionaires views vs public, moral superiority of having a job), 
and has serious consequences (blame the government, negative happiness, scarred for years)

We need to bring back land politics, (economic land, not just area). 
Addison Del Mastro <a href="https://thedeletedscenes.substack.com/p/an-embryonic-city">says</a> that 
size of cities is a matter of degree not kind, aka all cities are important. 
History of land including commons, later they became enclosed. 
Origin of 'landlord' comes from landlords and the landed gentry 
living off of land rents. The original political economist abhored these people who 
contributed nothing and were very rich. Also ties into to Social Gospel and Protestant work ethic.

Making Chicago Great Again, 
Chicago has a great urban core and can be built out more with TOD style development. 
Need to improve commuter rail and the metro (proper S-Bahn and Verkehrsverbund), 
income taxes are lower than Boston, LA, SF/Silicon Valley, NYC, Philly. Great universities and hospitals. 
Have downstate conservatives override Chicago area zoning laws, and focus on transit oriented development. 
Build HSR to St. Louis (then to Kansas City?), then Milwaukee extending to Madison and then Minneapolis/St. Paul. 
Then explore building rail to Indianapolis and then to Detroit. Get California style parental leave and sick pay. 
Reduce occupational licensing to the lowest standard of midwestern states (OH, MN, IA, IN, MI, MO)
On high speed rail specifically, what needs to be done to go to St. Louis, Minneapolis, and eastward (new tracks?, 
max speed of 320 vs 350?)
Paris to Bordeaux is 123 minutes at 320 max speed over 500 km
the current line to St. Louis is 457 km max speed of 180-220? I was wrong 177 km/h
Current line from Chicago to Detroit is 452 km, Detroit to Pontiac, MI is 37 km. Has a current max speed of 180 km/h.
Chicago to New Buffalo MI is 100 km, New Buffalo to Grand Rapids is 183 km. 
(Also includes St. Joseph and Holland, among others) planning to have a max speed of 180 km/h

growth and possibilities (surplus, capacity, productivity,and abundance) 
Ryan Avent on <a href="https://ryanavent.substack.com/p/the-perception-of-doors">possibilities, <a> 
Ryan Cooper <a href="https://www.ryanlcooper.com/these-are-the-stakes/">these are the stakes</a>,
cannot help but think of decade long underemployment in 2010s, 
what could have been without car centric development and white flight after WWII, etc. 
Edward Luce has a 
<a href="https://twitter.com/EdwardGLuce/status/1577979857744674816">provacatively titled column</a>
(have not read). Seems bad, reminds of misinformation/disinformation problems and how it is bad that foreign actors 
try to do it deliberately and if they succeed that is bad and if they fail it just sows suspicion. 
Polanyi <a href="https://twitter.com/delong/status/1568222600941240324"> best source for now</a>. 
I thought this <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/OPHMFG">FRED chart of manufacturing output growth</a> 
was highlighted by Ryan Avent, but maybe not that was central to an article he wrote.

what citizens should know about taxation 
Taxes and regulations, see Norwegian paper on green regulations being preferred, 
(there could be a compromise here where richer people agree to pay more taxes in exchange for fewer regulations, but devil is in the details)
ISP regulations (it’s all Polanyi), Melinda Cooper paper on Neoliberalism and the Virginia School, 
people think the government should spend more on various policy areas but don’t like higher taxes, 
Saez finding that tax increases are more likely to pass if tied to particular thing 
(China is forcing capitalists to give away money instead of taxing them
<a href="https://fortune.com/2021/08/06/china-big-tech-crackdown-billionaires-philanthropy-giving-donations/">link 1</a>
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-26/billionaire-donations-soar-in-china-push-for-common-prosperity">link 2</a>
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ywang/2021/08/26/chinas-tech-giants-are-giving-away-their-money-to-avoid-beijings-wrath/">link 3</a>), 
health insurance in United states is effectively a tax, 
Australia’s pension system mandates something like 401(k)s but doesn’t count that money as tax revenue, 
so it looks like Australia has low taxes
in US pensions are primarily Social Security taxes which makes it look like we tax more, 
The arguments we should have about taxation include what is funded, 
how we fund specific things like transportation or sales taxes vs income taxes, 
Excises taxes for example higher eco taxes, gas diesel airplanes air fuel energy industry elasticities, 
in US could do more of this and lower other taxes, 
levels don’t matter, see above with Australia vs US pensions, 
percent of gdp doesn’t matter, it is what household can actually buy and if you are making good investments
Adam Smith quote on purpose of production 
focus more on corruption and private incentives, and win win lowering of government spending while still achieving goals

disasters, life expectency, and commutes or why to care about more than money and wealth 
Avent on <a href="https://ryanavent.substack.com/p/a-growing-proble"> limits of growth </a>
Here is an example of caring about more than money, competitive cooperation in professional sports, 
where each team wants to maintain competition but they can’t permanently dominate or the competition and vitality of the competition would decline 
Similar analogy for politics where you could go scorched earth and win this time 
but then you would erode the political game and lose the good aspects of a stable competitive government:

Unemployment is underrated by politics (Kornai, millionaires views vs public, moral superiority of having a job), 
and has serious consequences (blame the government, negative happiness, scarred for years)

and we should talk reducing needs by having police do less, improve administration of taxes, investing in technology, etc. 
Matt Darling’s point about how you have no idea what the job market for your industry will be in 20 years. 
This seems to imply we need robust retraining and better social insurance. Also technology is unpredictable. 
And people are choosing their career as young adults mostly, when they are naive and maybe not fully developed.

Enclosures from Dan Snow and Katrina Navickas on History Hit: 
enclosures were public common land that was farmed by whoever share land with small plots
land wasn't private or didn't exist. but it this family farms here that family there 
nobles own land and administer on behalf of king. were closed off and right to farm was removed. 
land was enclosed for wood, later for wool, then for grain crops and food. was done for efficiency 
of making lots of agricultural products and promoting efficiency. 
shifted to wage labor instead of informal farming rights. then enclosures become acts of Parliament, 
and bureaucratic. people were worried about land prices and production efficiency in 1800s. 
there is an increase ir rual poverty because of the shift to wage labor and capital is more powerful 
than labor. Rural rebellion against enclosure happened. Church of England got lots of land from the 
Enclosure Acts passed by Parliament. Roads were remade for the convenience of agriculture. 
Right of way paths exist from the enclosures, but not right to roam like in Scandinavia. 
Idea of property ownership comes from 1500s. Rewilding seems like 'the Invention of Nature' book 
about Alexander von Humboldt and the return of 'nature'. 


History of land including commons, later they became enclosed. 
Origin of 'landlord' comes from landlords and the landed gentry.

<p id="chicago">
Making Chicago Great Again, 
Chicago has a great urban core and can be built out more with TOD style development. 
Need to improve commuter rail and the metro (proper 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-Bahn">S-Bahn</a> and 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_district#Germany">Verkehrsverbund</a> to govern public transit 
across the entire metro area), 
income taxes are lower than Boston, LA, SF/Silicon Valley, NYC, Philly, DC, Minneapolis, Madison. 
Chicago and the metro area are home to many universities, including Northwestern University, University of Chicago, 
and the University of Illinois in Chicago. Also, the health system and hospitals are good.  
Matt Yglesias likes to joke every once in a while that Texas conservatives should deregulate land to own the libs 
in Austin and other large cities in Texas, and Illinois conservatives could do the same to Chicago and to a lesser 
extent near St. Louis. Also, need to focus on transit oriented development. This is hard to say exactly what to do, 
but a well optimized political coalition in Chicago and Cook County is probably essential. What I mean is that 
a smart political movement could pull together deregulators who make it easy for the city to grow, 
then use the extra revenue to stabilize city services, and then start cutting taxes a bit. You want to retain people 
and make them invested in long term growth and governance. 
Reduce occupational licensing to the lowest standard of midwestern states (OH, MN, IA, IN, MI, MO). This will make 
it easier for people to move from the Midwest into the Chicago metro area, and is more deregulation. 
It would also be great to build high speed rail, starting with the Amtrak line to St. Louis.
Then you want to extend it to Milwaukee and Madison, if for nothing else than the airport and college students
Then you can maybe go to Kansas City and Madison on towards Minneapolis.
Then explore building rail to Indianapolis and then to Detroit or southwest Michigan. 
Get California style parental leave and sick pay, consider pulling as many policy levers as possible to make 
health insurance cheaper, although I recognize this is hard because United is headquarted in Chicago. 
On high speed rail specifically, what needs to be done to go to St. Louis, Minneapolis, and eastward (new tracks?, 
max speed of 320 vs 350?)
Paris to Bordeaux is 123 minutes at 320 max speed over 500 km
the current line to St. Louis is 457 km max speed of 180-220? I was wrong 177 km/h
Current line from Chicago to Detroit is 452 km, Detroit to Pontiac, MI is 37 km. Has a current max speed of 180 km/h.
Chicago to New Buffalo MI is 100 km, New Buffalo to Grand Rapids is 183 km. 
(Also includes St. Joseph and Holland, among others) planning to have a max speed of 180 km/h.

Here is an example of caring about more than money, competitive cooperation in professional sports, 
where each team wants to maintain competition but they can’t permanently dominate or the competition and vitality 
of the competition would decline

but then you would erode the political game and lose the good aspects of a stable competitive government:

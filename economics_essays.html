Unemployment is underrated by politics (kornai, millionaires views vs public, moral superiority of having a job),

We need to bring back land politics, reminds me of how in Fayetteville, North Carolina has a military base,

and how the doctors in Atul Gawande’s article about McAllen, Texas own everything.

Feygin et al dollar dominance Baumol and investment in tradable sectors 
economics post on what citizens should know about taxation 
Taxes and regulations, see Norwegian paper on green regulations being preferred, 
ISP regulations (it’s all Polanyi), Melinda Cooper paper on Neoliberalism and the Virginia School, 
people think the government should spend more on various policy areas but don’t like higher taxes, 
Saez finding that tax increases are more likely to pass if tied to particular thing 
(China is forcing capitalists to give away money instead of taxing them), 
health insurance in United states is effectively a tax, 
Australia’s pension system mandates something like 401(k)s but doesn’t count that money as tax revenue, in US they are counted as taxes, 
(there could be a compromise here where richer people agree to pay more taxes in exchange for fewer regulations, but devil is in the details) 
The arguments we should have about taxation include what is funded, 
how we fund specific things like transportation, levels don’t matter, percent of gdp doesn’t matter, 
focus more on corruption and private incentives and win win lowering of government payouts with no effect on quality of life, 

economics on what citizens should know about infrastructure 
economics post on fiscal federalism 
economics posts about disasters or why to care about more than money and wealth 
Here is an example of caring about more than money, competitive cooperation in professional sports, 
where each team wants to maintain competition but they can’t permanently dominate or the competition and vitality of the competition would decline 
Similar analogy for politics where you could go scorched earth and win this time 
but then you would erode the political game and lose the good aspects of a stable competitive government:

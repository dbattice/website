<h4>Unemployment</h4>
<p id="unemployment">
Unemployment is underrated by politics. There are many angles to this, but let's start with 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/János_Kornai">János Kornai</a>.
He was a Hungarian economist who lived in communist Hungary. He came to view central planning 
as a bad economic system and mathematically showed why. Basically, he showed that central planning 
leads to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortage_economy">persisent shortages</a> because of 
distortions of price signals. Kornai did think that non-socialist economies did have a flaw though, 
<a href="https://twitter.com/BuddyYakov/status/1451294315838259208">which is that they don't do enough 
to keep unemployment low</a>. Specifically, 
<a href="https://www.apricitas.io/p/capitalism-and-the-surplus-economy">he saw unemployment as surplus (or misallocated) labor</a>, 
and thought more effort should be given to make sure that society used all of its resources efficiently, including all workers.
Suppliers create surplus capacity and inventory to be able to dynamically respond to demand, 
even though there might be irrationally high amounts of surplus products and capacity. 
In his view, advertising is really a way to keep the inventory sales flowing. Governments can impede surplus, 
for example, in housing. Kornai saw unemployment as surplus labor, and seemed to agree with Marx’s 
analysis of unemployment as the ‘reserve army’.  Kornai’s work definitely points to better policies 
to maintain full employment and UI in lieu of it to maintain aggregate demand.
Sectoral unions and strong state spending are also probably ideal to help with this problem
(Sidenote: he also <a href="https://building-a-ruin.ghost.io/in-memory-of-janos-kornai/">wanted capacity planning</a>, 
but not socialist planning. This was to keep production high and to help relieve bottlenecks to production ahead of time.) 
Another reason unemployment is underrated has to do with class. I think it is believable that the richest people 
have the most influence on public policy, but even if not, it should be important to know where the policy preferences are 
for the richest people versus everyone else, so we can see how the richest might distort policy and see if the claim 
that they have the most influence is true. So 
<a href="https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/democracy-and-the-policy-preferences-of-wealthy-americans">Page, 
Bartels, and Seawright</a> got several millionaires and several ordinary people 
to answer a survey about whether the government should care more or less about different policy areas. This survey is 
very interesting, but one thing that stuck out to me is that, that normal people think that government should do a lot 
to reduce unemployment, like about two thirds. But among the millionaires, only about one third said it was an important problem.
And in the United States, the unemployment system is not generous, not centralized, not easy to access benefits, and 
makes recessions worse because it leads to declines in state and local tax revenues, which means the states and local governments 
start laying people off, inceasing unemployment even more. (Just look at the 2010s.) 
There is also an unfortunate view that is understandable, but naive, which is that people think they are morally superior 
to those who don't have a job. In reality, it is partly luck of the times. The other thing that proves this is 
not entirely reasonable is that if there is a lot of unemployment people will blame the government. So why does 
the government only get the blame for the bad thing and not (at least partly) get credit for the positive thing. 
I have some thoughts on that, but this is not the time. 
So blaming the government is bad because it undermines general social trust, which is very important. 
But also being unemployed for a siginificant period of time has the drop in happiness not as bad as a spouse dying, 
but shockingly close, and worse than divorce?
<a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/11/26/9793470/parenting-children-happiness">Here is some other work that 
finds having kids isn't as bad being unemployed</a>, despite what people say.

Here is a Bryan Caplan <a href="https://www.econlib.org/archives/2013/04/the_grave_evil.html">making the case 
that unemployment is bad and is a market failure</a> and also has some suggestions about how to fix it in a 
pro market way.

<a href="https://twitter.com/IrvingSwisher/status/1593965255046184963">Skanda Amarnath says</a> that 
costs of inflation are due to an arbitrary loss function that says we need 
to reduce jobs to keep inflation low. But the question that be asked is what are the costs of inflation vs 
unemployment, especially amongst those who are most likely to be unemployed by reducing inflation? Or 
are there other things we can do to offset the costs of inflation and unemployment to make the tradeoff not as severe?
Those are political questions that can be informed by economic research, but should not be assumed by 
central bankers, economists, or anyone else. 
<a href="https://fercirelli.github.io/personal_website/Cirelli_JMP.pdf">Fernando Cirelli</a> has a 
job market paper saying that higher inflation impacts poorer households ability to 
do precautionary saving. This is because lower income households tend to have most of their liquid savings in bank deposits, 
and banks do not fully pass through interest rates to depositors. This all adds up to inflation being born 
the most by lower income households because it hurts their net worth disproportionately.

Kalecki and inflation as conflict (for example,

the debt servicing went down, growth went up, globalization and inflation, inflation expectations, 
importance of having full employment (Morals and growth social change changes);

makes the very good point that different institutional arrangements can benefit different actors 
depending on those institutional arrangements. Basically social ownership evaporates any concerns about 
capitalists benefiting from inflation at the expense of the workers or strong unions can also do that. 
Also a reactive government can mitigate downsides too.

land was enclosed for wood, later for wool, then for grain crops and food. was done for efficiency 
of making lots of agricultural products and promoting efficiency. 
shifted to wage labor instead of informal farming rights. then enclosures become acts of Parliament, 
and bureaucratic. people were worried about land prices and production efficiency in 1800s. 
there is an increase ir rual poverty because of the shift to wage labor and capital is more powerful 
than labor. Rural rebellion against enclosure happened. Church of England got lots of land from the 
Enclosure Acts passed by Parliament. Roads were remade for the convenience of agriculture. 
Right of way paths exist from the enclosures, but not right to roam like in Scandinavia. 
Idea of property ownership comes from 1500s. See also Hernando de Soto.

<h4>Make Chicago Great Again</h4>
<p id="chicago">
<a href="https://chi.streetsblog.org/2022/07/22/yup-matthew-yglesias-is-wrong-that-chicago-is-doomed-heres-why/">Matt 
Yglesias probably shouldn't be as worried about Chicago</a>. 
Chicago has a great urban core and can be built out more with TOD style development. 
Need to improve commuter rail and the metro (proper 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-Bahn">S-Bahn</a> and 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_district#Germany">Verkehrsverbund</a> to govern public transit 
across the entire metro area), 
income taxes are lower than Boston, LA, SF/Silicon Valley, NYC, Philly, DC, Minneapolis, Madison if you are 
upper middle class. Chicago and the metro area are home to many universities, including Northwestern University, 
University of Chicago, and the University of Illinois in Chicago. Also, the health system and hospitals are good.  
Matt Yglesias likes to joke every once in a while that Texas conservatives should deregulate land to own the libs 
in Austin and other large cities in Texas, and Illinois conservatives could do the same to Chicago and to a lesser 
extent near St. Louis. Also, need to focus on transit oriented development. This is hard to say exactly what to do, 
but a well optimized political coalition in Chicago and Cook County is probably essential. What I mean is that 
a smart political movement could pull together deregulators who make it easy for the city to grow, 
then use the extra revenue to stabilize city services, and then start cutting taxes a bit. You want to retain people 
and make them invested in long term growth and governance. 
Reduce occupational licensing to the lowest standard of midwestern states (OH, MN, IA, IN, MI, MO). This will make 
it easier for people to move from the Midwest into the Chicago metro area, and is more deregulation. 
It would also be great to build high speed rail, starting with the Amtrak line to St. Louis.
Then you want to extend it to Milwaukee and Madison, if for nothing else than the airport and college students
Then you can maybe go to Kansas City and Madison on towards Minneapolis.
Then explore building rail to Indianapolis and then to Detroit or southwest Michigan. 
Get California style parental leave and sick pay, consider pulling as many policy levers as possible to make 
health insurance cheaper, although I recognize this is hard because United is headquarted in Chicago. 
On high speed rail specifically, what needs to be done to go to St. Louis, Minneapolis, and eastward (new tracks?, 
max speed of 320 vs 350?)
Paris to Bordeaux is 123 minutes at 320 max speed over 500 km
the current line to St. Louis is 457 km max speed of 180-220? I was wrong 177 km/h
Current line from Chicago to Detroit is 452 km, Detroit to Pontiac, MI is 37 km. Has a current max speed of 180 km/h.
Chicago to New Buffalo MI is 100 km, New Buffalo to Grand Rapids is 183 km. 
(Also includes St. Joseph and Holland, among others) planning to have a max speed of 180 km/h.

decreases stability because it undermines mutually assured destruction logic, so it is easier and cheaper to just 
build a much bigger arsenal and launch more nuclear weapons at once.

Herman Mark Schwartz was on the Political Economy Forum podcast and was walking through how Germany has kind of 
screwed over workers by making it easier to outsource and thus the remaining workers are less interested in those 
worker's unions. This is kind of like franchising labor. He is arguing that it really is a distinction in degree 
rather than kind. He also notes that Germany has just as high income inequality before taxes and transfers 
as the United States, but they redistribute more and redistribute better such that their post tax and transfer

<h4>Phillips curve or Phillips line?</h4>
<p>Is the Phillips curve a line or a curve? This seems kind of unimportant, but given the scale and consequences of 
excess unemployment the answer to this is incredibly important. Joe Gagnon and others at PIIE
<a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/case-raising-inflation-target-stronger-you-think">have done</a> 
<a href="https://www.piie.com/publications/policy-briefs/another-reason-raise-feds-inflation-target-employment-and-output-boom">some</a> 
<a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/keep-unemployment-low-central-banks-should-plan-raise-inflation-target">work 
on this</a>, and they think it is a curve, and other economists are erring when they think it is a line. 
Joe Gagnon talked about 
<a href="https://www.piie.com/publications/working-papers/25-years-excess-unemployment-advanced-economies-lessons-monetary-policy">his 
paper</a> on <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/macro-musings/joe-gagnon-25-years-excess-unemployment-and-phillips-curve-debate">Macro 
Musings</a>. 
Joe Gagnon thinks that the Phillips curve is nonlinear. I thought it was something like 
y=1/n^x where x>1, but apparently some people think that is it y=-m*x+b? 
(y is the inflation rate, and x is the unemployment rate gap.) (See this 
<a href="https://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2021/03/if-you-wanna-run-hot-you-gotta-run-steady.html">blog 
post by Worthwhile Canadian</a>, which clearly says it is a curve, not a line.) 
Joe Gagnon cites a paper from Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry that a lower a inflation target leads to higher U* or the 
unemployment rate at which inflation is steady, and also Joe Gagnon thinks that is where we are now. He also thinks that 
deviations from steady NGDP growth will show up sooner in a world with higher inflation, 
and that is why he likes NGDP targeting too. 
Joe Gagnon on Macro Musings in September 2023 missed an important point. They did not discuss labor share conflicts 
as part of inflation and seemed glad that the quits rate was falling, reflecting a looser labor market 
(aka slightly worse for workers). I wanted to yell at them that the Fed cannot control everything (nor probably should) 
and there is a role for fiscal policy in an ideal world. Example, housing, taxes, etc. Gagnon did make an 
interesting distinction between expectations and confidence around inflation and macro policy, which I think 
is the most defensible version of ‘inflation expectations’. They also think that R* will remain lower, 
even if it is temporarily higher. Gagnon thinks that with a low R*, and also to avoid the zero lower bound 
(and nominal rigidities), we should have an inflation target of 3%. They also reference Ricardo Reis who 
thinks that raising interest rates will reduce employment or wage growth as a *side effect*, but not a cause 
and it is not always guaranteed to happen. 
This is because the economy would be operating closer to the Y axis (lower unemployment rate) where the 1/x^n 
curve has a steeper slope when you change the X variable slightly. 
He also says something very interesting that he thinks NGP targeting is only 
possible with higher nominal growth target so that way you see deviations faster. 
(Side note here: the <a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2020/january/what-is-phillips-curve-why-flattened">Phillips 
curve</a> existed until the 1970s or so. Then it became a negatively sloping line, 
then in the 1990s it flipped back to a curve, I guess?)  
<a href="https://stayathomemacro.substack.com/p/ban-the-phillips-curve">Claudia Sahm doesn't think the 
Phillips curve is useful</a>, because the tradeoffs of inflation and unemployment 
would almost certainly change over time. Also, demography, technology, and productivity will change the tradeoffs as well. 
<a href="https://www.employamerica.org/blog/its-about-the-supply-side-how-the-phillips-curve-motte-and-bailey-misses-and-misspecifies-inflation-dynamics/">Skanda 
Amarnath</a> also pointed this out in the context of the 2023 disinflation, highlighting how supply chains and 
productivity have contributed to the disinflation, meaning the Phillips curve didn't apply in the post Covid inflation episode.   
I mostly agree that the trade offs are not as clear cut, although I think Gagnon is correct in the extreme case
of a sudden jump in inflation.
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/09/08/1197953033/bill-phillips-curve-history">Alan Blinder on Planet Money 
said that he doesn't think the Phillips curve has been useful since 1990s until 2021</a> because
unemployment swung wildly without much change in inflation, so it is a broken tool. 
Chris Hughes made the case that 
<a href="https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/rethinking-arthur-burns-the-worst-fed-chair-in-history/">Arthur Burns 
was ahead of the curve by trying non monetary measures to reduce inflation, but this was forgotten in general. 
<a href="https://www.mercatus.org/macro-musings/chris-hughes-legacy-arthur-burns-and-its-implications-macro-policy-today">Chris 
Hughes on Macro Musings said that Arthur Burns</a> was focused on unions, regulations, supply side factors, etc. 
as the cause of inflation problems. Arthur Burns also didn’t believe in the 
Phillips Curve, and he thought that inflation was bad because it distorted investment decisions. 
Chris Hughes also says we need to build capacity to quickly roll out infrastructure and 
other policy measures to combat inflation, since we mostly don’t have it now. 
So, as an outsider I find this troubling. This concept is central so many central bankers' thinking that one has to 
think about it when thinking about monetary policy or even just macroeconomic policy. But they can't even 
figure out the relationship graphically between inflation and unemployment? Especially when the consequences are 
so important (see the high cost of unemployment in so many ways.) Ultimately, I support switching to NGDP targeting, 
which Joe Gagnon mostly agrees with, 
in addition to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_income_target">so many other people</a>. 
I think it is pretty compelling that the Phillips curve is a curve, but also is not that useful. We should focus more 
on NGDP and on non-monetary policy levers to lower inflation and increase employment, 
or at least coordinate monetary and non-monetary actions 
to reduce inflation with minimal employment effects. And that is such a huge topic it deserves it own essay.

<p>New Zealand is going to <a href="https://twitter.com/ritwik_priya/status/1371520689438621704">consider 
housing prices for its monetary policy</a>, which might be worse because it is creating a new gold standard.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f1gYw8HRxM">Claudia Sahm is not a fan of raising the inflation target</a>. 
I think this is tricky because it would have 
gotten us better monetary policy in the 2010s, but credibility is something you don’t want to squander. 
<a href="https://www.mercatus.org/publications/monetary-policy/fate-of-fait-salvaging-fed-framework">David Beckworth 
and Patrick Horan argue for NGDP targeting as a better version of the FAIT</a> introduced in 2020 by the Fed. 
It would have performed better in the 2008 financial crisis and the late 2021 and 2022 inflation surge. 
</p>
<p>
Why did central banks adopt inflation targets rather than nominal income/spending/GDP targets? 
Seems like it would be easier to target, measure, and explain. I found this 
<a href="https://www.nbs.sk/_img/documents/_publik_nbs_fsr/biatec/rok2013/03-2013/02_biatec13-3_sivak">article 
which gives weak justifications</a> in my view.
Ed Dolan thinks we need to <a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/does-targeting-supercore-inflation-make-sense/">move 
beyond the headline inflation number</a> and I agree, but only because we should do NGDP targeting, 
which I think is taking the idea to its logical end. 
I also have heard about a price level target, which will try to have greater inflation after a period of low inflation. 
Here is a paper by Fackler and McMillin on that which seems to find 
<a href="https://www.mercatus.org/publications/monetary-policy/evaluation-nominal-gdp-versus-price-level-">NGDP 
is better than inflation level targeting. 
Interesting <a href="https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/confs/2018/mcdermott-williams.html">review of New Zealand 
inflation targeting</a> as they were the first ones to do it. 
They moved the target from 0-2% up to 1-3% but trying to get 2%. They also realized that focusing 
on one macro variable tends to have excessive fluctuations in other variables, so they realized 
that there is a tradeoff between volatility of inflation and unemployment, but not between inflation and unemployment. 
Also the US basically adopted the 2% because <a href="https://twitter.com/jeannasmialek/status/1574521132278960128">New 
Zealand did</a> and then Yellen argued it was better than 0% or 3%, because of measurement errors and costs 
of being slightly wrong. 
</p>
<p>
There are a lot of <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/Sumner-NGDP-Targeting-sum-v1.pdf">political 
reasons to favor NGDP targeting</a>. First of all, it is an explicit, simple to understand mandate. 
Simplicity is very good in general, and it is better to have one mandate than two (or three?) that you have to balance. 
Psychologically NGDP targeting is better because feelings and expectations are more tied to economic behavior 
in a crisis than actually 
calculating inflation adjusted prices and realizing that even though my wages have barely gone up, I actually have 
increasing compensation and purchasing power far greater than I used to. (If that sounds complicated and ridiculous, 
that’s the point.) 
NGDP targeting also reduces politicization of a critical aspect of the modern economy, because the main question 
of the Federal Reserve will be if it is maintaing steady NGDP growth and if it does, nothing is wrong 
(putting aside ethics scandals and the like). Carola Binder has also made the 
<a href="https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/spring/summer-2020/ngdp-targeting-public">case that NGDP targeting is robust to 
populist pressures</a>, and may even help long run growth further weaking the chance of a populist movement growing 
through robust growth. Also reflects questions of distribution and growth back to the politicians. 
There has always been a debate between ‘hawks’ and ‘doves’ and this would sidestep that debate entirely, 
and put the onus on politicians to do better fiscal and regulatory policy. This means structural reform 
to have higher production, higher growth means lower inflation (which is good for the incumbent party looking to be reelected), 
also potential to have less boom-bust cycles because finance is more secure and robust.
It also really puts the onus on Congress to do things about inequality, investment, or favor certain sectors (or not),
which is where those debates should be happening, not amongst unelected technocrats whose decisions affect millions of people 
and trillions of dollars. Speaking of which, stimulus won’t really work because it causes inflation which will eat 
into the growth and it is just redirecting spending from one thing to another. 
(This probably comes more from the Austrian view that stimulus doesn’t work, but I don’t think this is a very strong point.)
A much stronger but related point is that bailouts likely won’t happen (as much) because that would be allocating 
a specified fraction of the economy to the bailout, which is likely to be unpopular because people would rather 
that money be used on something else or rather not bailout a failing business. 
</p>
<p>
Covid and its aftermath really showed the importance of not tightening too much or too little when appropriate. 
I think it is just better policy when nominal incomes are maintained as it is really hard to know much supply shocks 
will feed into inflation and how quickly the supply shocks will fade, especially when there are geopolitical causes or 
random freak occurences, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ever_Given"><i>Ever Given</i> getting stuck</a>. 
NGDP targeting limits the growth of debt/credit in good times, and inflation is countercyclical. 
Most people and businesses think nominally anyway, especially in contracts. Finance would likely 
shift away from “safe assets” typically meaning government bonds. Also there should be less 
risk aversion and preference for straight cash because the nominal economy is growing at a predictable rate, 
so in slower times, more cash will become available via monetary policy, but not too much because the 
growth will be predictable. Predictable policy so people and businesses can plan long-term with less risks.
Claudia Sahm’s idea of sending money to households can be the one final backstop to ensure nominal growth 
continues in the gravest of crises. It is also a more equitable way to increase growth and manage crises. 
(Add more information on helicopter money and QE, which comes up frequently in monetary policy, 
including from Yellen’s old work in NGDP targeting.) 
Another thing to probably add with this is an NGDP futures market. Current monetary policy lags the actual economy and 
decisions made by central banks. Create a market where people can effectively bet on their predictions of 
how much the economy will grow in nominal terms in the next quarter or quarters. There are a bunch of other things 
that need to be considered to make such a tool work. 
Also, an empirical <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w22505">study found that the prediction about the damage 
of too high inflation was not nearly as evident in past data as predicted, meaning that high inflation is not as 
costly as high unemployment</a>. They also find that price stickiness has not gone down in the last few decades. 
One group of economists compared various central banks targets and which is optimal and found the NGDP targeting 
is almost as good as output targeting, but with some noise, it is probably better. 
<a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w21420/w21420.pdf">NGDP targeting works well 
in the face of supply shocks</a>, and short term inflation changes. 
<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12602">Beckworth and Hendrickson found that 
NGDP targeting is better than the Taylor Rule</a> because 
of output gap estimate errors that naturally occur with basically all real time economic data 
and would reduce volatility in inflation and output with imperfect information. I think it is worth saying that 
if we target NGPD, then over time I would expect estimates of NGDP in real time to get better (and probably faster?) 
as more people put effort into it and develop new tools and ways of measuring NGDP.
<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/frankel-slides.pdf">Frankel here points out that 
in the 2010s, the Federal Reservce couldn't get to 2% inflation consistently</a>. It also has to abandon 
the inflation target when shocks happen. Of the the three flaws with NGDP targeting, two of them apply to 
inflation targeting and one goes back to data in real time, which I already noted can be mitigated over time.
Frankel also wrote about how 
<a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/central-banks-can-phase-nominal-gdp-targets-without-damaging-inflation-anchor">switching 
to NGDP targeting can provide stimulus in the transtion</a>.
Joseph Politano explained <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaqezJAb_2Y">gross labor income targeting</a> 
perfectly on Narratives podcast. The idea is NGDP is hard to measure in real time accurately, 
but labor income is easier to measure and is the most sensitive in the short run to macro conditions, 
so if you get labor income growing steadily, the rest of the economy will take care of itself. (Most 
people's income comes from labor income or Social Security.)
How is gross labor floor targeting different from an NGP target? 

(I did find this weird <a href="https://www.alt-m.org/2019/10/15/lars-svensson-on-ngdp-targeting/">critique of 
NGDP targeting</a>. Selgin thinks that the inflation targeting is more consistent with the dual mandate. Maybe I don't 
understand, but I guess I am thinking we should be open to changing the mandate and Selgin thinks we will not change it. 
I think politically it would be quite a fight to change the mandate, but that doesn't mean it wouldn't be ideal. 
Selgin does make an interesting point that fluctuating input or factor prices can lead to very unusual NGDP data, 
like <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/macro-musings/zac-gross-past-present-and-future-australian-monetary-policy">Zac 
Gross has said about Australia</a>, where a significant portion of their economy is dependent on mineral prices. 
So in that context I agree that NGDP targeting probably isn't ideal, although I think gross labor floor might 
still be workable.

<h4>Progressive should embrace markets in some areas</h4>
<p>This is for some areas. Some areas it doesn't matter, some areas should be socialized or heavily regulated.
However, the main areas progressive should embrace markets are housing, occupational licensing,
health insurance, telecoms like EU, carbon pricing instead of income taxes, energy (depends on specifics), 
DBCFT and VAT instead of corporate tax, end subsidization of private retirement funding (401ks etc) and 
expand social security, tax cars more, do more ownership stakes in business when giving them startup funds, 
Georgism more and income taxes less, Green TVA?
The <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/new-jones-act-ship-offers-cautionary-tale-shipbuilding-protectionism">Jones Act</a> 
doesn't work anymore and doesn't achieve its goal of helping the US shipbuilding industry, and 
<a href="https://catalyst.independent.org/2024/01/03/lng-ruling-jones-act/">undermines other goals</a>. 
Here is another <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/how-would-jones-act-reform-impact-us-shipbuilding">article</a> that 
says that repealing the Jones Act wouldn't completely devestate the industry because right now a lot of the work 
is done by foreign companies, and the US still makes good river barges. And that leads me to the point 
that it is kind of arbitrary what must be done in the US to qualify as domestic for purposes of the Jones Act. 
Ships can be designed abroad, several components can come from abroad, and the ship can still qualify as domestic. 
Meanwhile the whole point was to subsidize the shipbuilding industry so we could ramp up production with the latest 
and greatest technology, but who is to say that is the best way to maintain shipbuilding capacity with the 
best available technology? It certainly seems to me that in 2023 it is not. Maybe it would be better to fund vocational 
schools that teach people how to make ships well. Maybe it would be better to fund research directly on shipping technology. 
Maybe it would be better to regulate the ships used for certain emissions and safety standards, like we do for motor vehicles. 
Maybe we give tax credits if a percentage of a shipping company's cargo is carried on ships constructed in the United States, 
so that shipbuilders have a reason to become cost competitive with the rest of the world, but shipping companies can choose 
non-American ships in a way that is not as costly to consumers. We could also exempt remote locations, like the various island 
territories, Hawaii, Alaska, etc, from the Jones Act, or exempt certain goods, like oil, semiconductors and electronics, 
or food. I am just throwing ideas out there, but these seem better on the surface and deserve more exploration and research.

Also the dredging law and that Odd Lots episode.

A libertarian has written a good <a href="https://lppapers.substack.com/p/lp-11-deregulation-a-code-word-for">primer</a> 
on why deregulation can be good, although I would take issue with alcohol (do we really want cheaper alcohol? 
Just socialize the companies somewhat to prevent bad incentives) 
and banking (we always bail out banks so maybe we should partially nationalize some banks too?) for example.
On other hand, car dealerships definitely deserve more scrutiny and it would be good politcally because 
car dealership owners are major Republican backers and they have the money, small business status, and distributed 
geographic power that give it outsized influence. 
Kimberly Clausing also wrote a book about trade and why progressives should back it. One of the points 
she made is that tariffs are bad because they tend to be applied to goods that are disproportionately consumed 
by lower income people, and of course it is just a regressive tax, and benefits companies not consumers. 
(I get that sometimes there are reasons to have tariffs, but for so many goods in the US today, this is not the case.)

<p>Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson have a new <a href="https://twitter.com/DAcemogluMIT/status/1659510459064623104">book 
on technology and society which also gets into labor power, automation, and politics. 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGqaOhTq060">Here Daron Acemoglu is saying that technology is not 
good or bad, but it depends on how it used in society. He also is skeptical of centralized data and ad based businesses 
because it restricts the possibility of competitors with different business models. 
Noah Smith wrote a <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/book-review-power-and-progress">rebuttal to shaping 
the technology and argued we should improve institutions to be robust to technological changes</a>. Specifically, 
he wants to build labor power so that unions don’t feel so threatened by automation, and have a long term 
interest in technology, and can demand that they get a share of the gains. (Interesting how he cites the 
automation of the port in Rotterdam and also codetermination in Germany.) Noah Smith also says that 
we need to beef up our welfare state, probably by introducing more schemes to help workers reallocate or 
just give them more cash. Even more on the book, 
<a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/why-trying-to-shape-ai-innovation">noting its bad examples</a>. 
Dean Baker also <a href="https://cepr.net/ai-job-loss-and-productivity-growth/">made a very good point that we can 
change the rules of the economy to make sure that the rich are not the only ones to get richer from technology</a>, 
by citing his favorite examples of doctors being protected from foreign competition, 
but not manufacturing workers. He explicitly says that high unemployment and high inequality are 
political choices, not a consequence of technology and the economy or the laws of nature.

<h4>Coordination, unions, investment, and inflation</h4>
<p>Coordination would solve so many problems. Unions should be part of this and we need vision of better unions.
Unions should be sectoral unions, not based on one establishment in one place. Also tripartite negotiations.
Here is how <a href="https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2024/02/21/understanding-labor-unions-in-finland/">unions 
work in Finland</a>, in light of the 2024 strikes. There are sectoral unions, really just three. They negotiate and 
can have a large influence on policy. In 2024, they are protesting the cuts in unemployment and disability payments, 
along with weakened unions and strike rules. And most Finns support this. In Denmark there are tripartite negotiations,

part I</a>. <a href="https://bm.dk/media/19251/the-labour-market-in-denmark.pdf">Part II</a>.
More generally, <a href="https://wol.iza.org/articles/the-danish-labor-market">Denmark</a>
is very good at maintaining flexibility, reducing unemployment spells, and having a dynamic labor market. 
Does seems like you need strong unions and generous UI and training to make it work though.

Hopefully the coordination mechanism would lead to a more sensible welfare state, like Swiss split payroll taxes

A vision of better unions, social dialogue on benefits which should lead to split payroll taxes

<h4>A brief history of the minimum wage</h4>
<p>Nobel prize speech by 
<a href="https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/quotation-of-the-day-james-buchanan-on-the-minimum-wage/">Buchanan</a> 
said people who think raising minimum wage doesn't increase unemployment is like 
<a href="https://zacharydcarter.substack.com/p/the-new-nobel-prize-milton-friedman">believing that water flows uphill</a>. 
The first minimum wage study that I know of is looking at restaurants on the border between 
New Jersey and Pennsylvania because New Jersey increased the minimum wage and Pennsylvania didn’t. 
This <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w4509">study</a> is done by two famous economists 
David Card and Alan Krueger. They found that minimum wage just didn’t matter 
that much for employment or wages. </p> Particularly, they looked at the changes in restaurants and other 
low wage sectors that are most likely to be impacted by the increased minimum wage, and found little to no 
effect (maybe even a slight increase? But more on that later.) (Later research by Luca and Luca found that 
<a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/33111775/17-088.pdf">higher 
minimum wages seem to speed up failure of restaurant firms</a>). 
<p>There was also research done in Seattle and it didn’t seem to matter that much at the beginning as they were 
ramping up to $15/hour but it did matter later. Lately, there has been more evidence that this is because 
of the labor market concentration that I mentioned earlier. Since Amazon is a large employer that pays its 
lower wage workers the same, they kind of act as minimum wages in the areas where they have large amounts 
of workers. This is also reinforcing some rural-urban economic divides because most people live in areas 
with large concentrations of employers. So raising the minimum wage is actually helpful IF wages are being 
held down to a significant degree, such that employers have to shell out a little more money for wages 
acting as a de-facto stimulus. 
Another thing I want to note is that some states have tied their minimum wage to inflation and others have not, 
including the federal government. There is a chart with the inflation adjusted minimum wage and the peak 
was basically the 1960’s. But then you start getting in to which inflation, and that is an entirely separate discussion.
So the reason that this seems to be the case is that labor markets are highly concentrated, which means 
most people don't have a plethora of options of employers to work for in a given geographic area and skills. 
Unlike, say, cereal, or televesions, there aren't many options. 
In 2016, the White House Council of Economic Advisors wrote an 
<a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/page/files/20161025_monopsony_labor_mrkt_cea.pdf">issue 
brief on labor market concnetration and some 
of the labor market practices and laws that enhance labor monopsony. They also point out that 
with higher labor market concentration, the link between productivity and wages is lower. There is 
<a href="http://jhr.uwpress.org/content/early/2020/05/04/jhr.monopsony.1218-9914R1.full.pdf">good evidence 
that this is the case from Azar, Ioanescu, and Steinbaum</a>.
There is also evidence from Amazon. When Amazon builds a warehouse in a new location and pays its workers 
at least $15 an hour, that sets a <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2018/10/02/examples-monopsony-amazon-wages/">de 
facto minimum wage that other lower wage employers have to match to prevent workers from going to Amazon. 
There is also geographic monopsony for teachers because there isn't more than one school district to give teachers 
options. (Female dominance in teaching and motherhood probably affect this too, but that is a whole discussion.) 
In Seattle, a <a href="https://evans.uw.edu/new-evidence-from-the-seattle-minimum-wage-study/">minimum wage 
increase</a> reduced hours for some lower wage employees, but still raised earning for those 
whose wage increased because of the law. 
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?graph_id=529071">Real minimum wage</a> peaked in 1968, according to CPI.
Minimum wage increase in German lead to a <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/p/crm/wpaper/2007.html">reallocation 
of workers</a> to larger, higher paying firms. It also only explained some of the total wage increase. 
<a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55410">CBO did a report on minimum wage</a> at $10, $12, $15/hr and 
its effects on employment wages. It seems there are little effects at the beginning of the increases, 
but seems to see lower jobs five to ten years out. 
<a href="https://www.econtalk.org/noah-smith-on-worker-compensation-co-determination-and-market-power/">Noah 
Smith and Russ Roberts talked about minimum wage</a> and they disagreed but highlighted monopsony 
and other labor and capital things in one of their episodes of Econtalk together. 
<a href="https://twitter.com/arindube/status/1575317108992286720">Arin Dube</a> saying that there is so much 
data on minimum wage that if the true effect is ~0%, then there is lots of data finding positive 
and negative effects because there is a lot of noise. I also think the minimum wage literature is the 
go-to example in economics of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8543.2009.00723.x">publication 
bias</a>.

Unemployment is underrated by politics (Kornai, millionaires views vs public, moral superiority of having a job), 
and has serious consequences (blame the government, negative happiness, scarred for years),

Enclosures from Dan Snow and Katrina Navickas on History Hit: 
enclosures were public common land that was farmed by whoever share land with small plots
land wasn't private or didn't exist. but it this family farms here that family there 
nobles own land and administer on behalf of king. were closed off and right to farm was removed. 
land was enclosed for wood, later for wool, then for grain crops and food. was done for efficiency 
of making lots of agricultural products and promoting efficiency. 
shifted to wage labor instead of informal farming rights. then enclosures become acts of Parliament, 
and bureaucratic. people were worried about land prices and production efficiency in 1800s. 
there is an increase ir rual poverty because of the shift to wage labor and capital is more powerful 
than labor. Rural rebellion against enclosure happened. Church of England got lots of land from the 
Enclosure Acts passed by Parliament. Roads were remade for the convenience of agriculture. 
Right of way paths exist from the enclosures, but not right to roam like in Scandinavia. 
Idea of property ownership comes from 1500s. See also Hernando de Soto. 
<a href="https://sites.udel.edu/britlitwiki/the-enclosure-acts/">Enclosure Acts</a> from University of Delaware 
says that Parliament made thousands of acts that assigned land ownership. Most villages were self-sufficient.
Enclosure along with infrastructure helped lead to agricultural knowledge spreading across England.

<p id="chicago">
<a href="https://chi.streetsblog.org/2022/07/22/yup-matthew-yglesias-is-wrong-that-chicago-is-doomed-heres-why/">Matt 
Yglesias shouldn't be as worried about Chicago</a> 
Making Chicago Great Again, 
Chicago has a great urban core and can be built out more with TOD style development. 
Need to improve commuter rail and the metro (proper 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-Bahn">S-Bahn</a> and 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_district#Germany">Verkehrsverbund</a> to govern public transit 
across the entire metro area), 
income taxes are lower than Boston, LA, SF/Silicon Valley, NYC, Philly, DC, Minneapolis, Madison. 
Chicago and the metro area are home to many universities, including Northwestern University, University of Chicago, 
and the University of Illinois in Chicago. Also, the health system and hospitals are good.  
Matt Yglesias likes to joke every once in a while that Texas conservatives should deregulate land to own the libs 
in Austin and other large cities in Texas, and Illinois conservatives could do the same to Chicago and to a lesser 
extent near St. Louis. Also, need to focus on transit oriented development. This is hard to say exactly what to do, 
but a well optimized political coalition in Chicago and Cook County is probably essential. What I mean is that 
a smart political movement could pull together deregulators who make it easy for the city to grow, 
then use the extra revenue to stabilize city services, and then start cutting taxes a bit. You want to retain people 
and make them invested in long term growth and governance. 
Reduce occupational licensing to the lowest standard of midwestern states (OH, MN, IA, IN, MI, MO). This will make 
it easier for people to move from the Midwest into the Chicago metro area, and is more deregulation. 
It would also be great to build high speed rail, starting with the Amtrak line to St. Louis.
Then you want to extend it to Milwaukee and Madison, if for nothing else than the airport and college students
Then you can maybe go to Kansas City and Madison on towards Minneapolis.
Then explore building rail to Indianapolis and then to Detroit or southwest Michigan. 
Get California style parental leave and sick pay, consider pulling as many policy levers as possible to make 
health insurance cheaper, although I recognize this is hard because United is headquarted in Chicago. 
On high speed rail specifically, what needs to be done to go to St. Louis, Minneapolis, and eastward (new tracks?, 
max speed of 320 vs 350?)
Paris to Bordeaux is 123 minutes at 320 max speed over 500 km
the current line to St. Louis is 457 km max speed of 180-220? I was wrong 177 km/h
Current line from Chicago to Detroit is 452 km, Detroit to Pontiac, MI is 37 km. Has a current max speed of 180 km/h.
Chicago to New Buffalo MI is 100 km, New Buffalo to Grand Rapids is 183 km. 
(Also includes St. Joseph and Holland, among others) planning to have a max speed of 180 km/h.

<p id="inflation">
Kalecki, inflation as conflict (for example, 
<a href="https://economicsfromthetopdown.com/2023/03/23/inflation-the-battle-between-creditors-and-workers/">Blair 
Fix</a> talking about this), inflation from 2008 onwards, the economy of the 2020s is amazing: inflation went down then up,
the debt servicing went down, growth went up, globalization and inflation, inflation expectations, 
importance of having full employment (Morals and growth social change changes); 
<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/what-caused-the-u-s-pandemic-era-inflation/">Brookings 
on inflation in 2020s</>,
<a href="https://mattbruenig.com/2023/07/10/two-examples-of-capturing-inflation-driven-revenue/">Matt Bruenig</a> 
makes the very good point that different institutional arrangements can benefit different actors 
depending on those institutional arrangements. Basically social ownership evaporates any concerns about 
capitalists benefiting from inflation at the expense of the workers or strong unions can also do that. 
Also a reactive government can mitigate downsides too.

<h6>Phillips curve or Phillips line?</h6>
<p>Is the Phillips curve a line or a curve? This seems kind of unimportant, but given the scale and consequences of 
excess unemployment the answer to this is incrediblely important. Joe Gagnon and others at PIIE
<a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/case-raising-inflation-target-stronger-you-think">have done</a> 
<a href="https://www.piie.com/publications/policy-briefs/another-reason-raise-feds-inflation-target-employment-and-output-boom">some 
<a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/keep-unemployment-low-central-banks-should-plan-raise-inflation-target">work 
on this, and they think it is a curve, and other economists are erring when they think it is a line. 
Joe Gagnon talked about 
<a href="https://www.piie.com/publications/working-papers/25-years-excess-unemployment-advanced-economies-lessons-monetary-policy">his 
paper on <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/macro-musings/joe-gagnon-25-years-excess-unemployment-and-phillips-curve-debate">Macro 
Musings. 
Joe Gagnon thinks that the Phillips curve is nonlinear. I thought it was something like 
y=1/n^x where x>1, but apparently some people think that is it y=-m*x+b? 
(y is the inflation rate, and x is the unemployment rate gap.) (See this 
<a href="https://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2021/03/if-you-wanna-run-hot-you-gotta-run-steady.html">blog 
post by Worthwhile Canadian</a>, which clearly says it is a curve, not a line.) 
Joe Gagnon cites a paper from Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry that a lower a inflation target leads to higher U* or 
unemployment rate and which inflation is steady, and also Joe Gagnon thinks that is where we are now. He also thinks that 
deviations from steady NGDP growth will show up sooner in a world with higher inflation, 
and that is why he likes NGDP targeting too. 
This is because the economy would be operating closer to the Y axis where the 1/x^n curve has a steeper slope when you 
change the X variable slightly. He also says something very interesting that he thinks NGP targeting is only 
possible with higher nominal growth targetso that way you see deviations faster. 
(Side note here: the <a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2020/january/what-is-phillips-curve-why-flattened">Phillips 
curve</a> existed until the 1970s or so. Then it became a negatively sloping line, 
then in the 1990s it flipped back to a curve, I guess?)  
<a href="https://stayathomemacro.substack.com/p/ban-the-phillips-curve">Claudia Sahm doesn't think the 
Phillips curve is useful</a>, because the tradeoffs of inflation and unemployment 
would almost certainly change over time. Also, demography, technology, and productivity will change the tradeoffs as well. 
I mostly agree, although I think Gagnon is correct in the extreme case.  
So, as an outsider I find this troubling. This concept is central so many central bankers' thinking that one has to 
think about it when thinking about monetary policy or even just macroeconomic policy. But they can't even 
figure out the shape of the curve? Especially when the consequences are so important (see the high cost of 
unemployment in so many ways.) Ultimately, I support switching to NGDP targeting, which Joe Gagnon mostly agrees with, 
in addition to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_income_target">so many other people</a>. 
So I think it is pretty compelling that the Phillips curve is a curve, but also is not that useful. We should focus more 
on NGDP and focusing on non-monetary policy to lower inflation or at least coordinate monetary and non-monetary actions 
to reduce inflation. And that is such a huge topic it deserves it own essay.

<h6>Progressive should embrace markets in some areas</h6>
<p>This is for some areas. Some areas it doesn't matter, some areas should be socialized or heavily regulated.
However, the main areas progressive should embrace markets are housing, occupational licensing,
health insurance, telecoms like EU, carbon pricing instead of income taxes, energy (depends on specifics), 
DBCFT and VAT instead of corporate tax, end subsidization of private retirement funding (401ks etc) and 
expand social security, tax cars more, do more ownership stakes in business when giving them startup funds, 
Geogrism more and income taxes less, Green TVA?
The <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/new-jones-act-ship-offers-cautionary-tale-shipbuilding-protectionism">Jones Act</a> 
doesn't work anymore and doesn't achieve its goal of helping the US shipbuilding industry. 
Here is another <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/how-would-jones-act-reform-impact-us-shipbuilding">article</a> that 
says that repealing the Jones Act wouldn't completely devestate the industry because right now a lot of the work 
is done by foreign companies, and the US still makes good river barges. And that leads me to the point 
that it is kind of arbitrary what must be done in the US to qualify as domestic for purposes of the Jones Act. 
Ships can be designed abroad, several components can come from abroad, and the ship can still qualify as domestic. 
Meanwhile the whole point was to subsidize the shipbuilding industry so we could ramp up production with the latest 
and greatest technology, but who is to say that is the best way to maintain shipbuilding capacity with the 
best available technology? It certainly seems to me that in 2023 it is not. Maybe it would be better to fund vocational 
schools that teach people how to make ships well. Maybe it would be better to fund research directly on shipping technology. 
Maybe it would be better to regulate the ships used for certain emissions and safety standards, like we do for motor vehicles. 
Maybe we give tax credits if a percentage of a shipping company's cargo is carried on ships constructed in the United States, 
so that shipbuilders have a reason to become cost competitive with the rest of the world, but shipping companies can choose 
non-American ships in a way that is not as costly to consumers. We could also exempt remote locations, like the various island 
territories, Hawaii, Alaska, etc, from the Jones Act, or exempt certain goods, like oil, semiconductors and electronics, 
or food. I am just throwing ideas out there, but these seem better on the surface and deserve more exploration and research.

A libertarian has written a good <a href="https://lppapers.substack.com/p/lp-11-deregulation-a-code-word-for">primer</a> 
on why deregulation can be good, although I would take issue with alcohol (do we really want cheaper alcohol? 
Just socialize the companies somewhat to prevent bad incentives) 
and banking (we always bail out banks so maybe we should partially nationalize some banks too?) for example.
On other hand, car dealerships definitely deserve more scrutiny and it would be good politcally because 
car dealership owners are major Republican backers and they have the money, small business status, and distributed 
geographic power that give it outsized influence. 
Kimberly Clausing also wrote a book about trade and why progressives should back it. One of the points 
she made is that tariffs are bad because they tend to be applied to goods that are disproportionately consumed 
by lower income people, and of course it is just a regressive tax, and benefits companies not consumers. 
(I get that sometimes there are reasons to have tariffs, but for so many goods in the US today, this is not the case.)

<h6>Policy implications of globalization, AI, and remote work</h6>
Also immigration, energy, manufacturing, defense (conscription), citizenship laws. Probably have to tax consumption more.
Domestic workforce skills (German apprenticeships? Subsidize vocational training? don't require degrees for 
government jobs like in Pennsylvania under Josh Shapiro.) Work force mobility. Governance issues. 
Services regulation is very important, especially health and education. Construction to, to the extent mobility 
and population growth matter, along with hyper local services. Likes port automation maybe? Think about decarbonization too.
Don't ignore hubs of particular industry (think spatial equilibrium over time), and think through unions.

Need to fix infrastructure regulations too. 
Italy is quite good, but also Korea, and Nordics that haven't globalized to much.

proposed hiring more high level technocrats from other countries. Specifically, it probably is good 
for internationals to be in international economic policy making to some degree, 
but also people who have worked outside of central banking some.

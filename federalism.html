Fiscal Federalism and Its Discontents

"I hate paying taxes. But I love the civlization they give me." - Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.

Taxes are the fundamental power of the state. States cannot do anything without tax revenue. 
Taxes seem to have

developed with civilization</a>. 
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/history-of-taxes/">The Rosetta Stone is mostly a tax document. </a>
One of the primary functions of states historically was defense. Hendickson, Slater, and Albrecht have a paper on this, 
called 
<a href="https://scholars.ttu.edu/en/publications/preventing-plunder-military-technology-capital-accumulation-and-e">Preventing Plunder</a>. 
<a href="https://www.mercatus.org/bridge/podcasts/05162022/josh-hendrickson-economic-growth-national-defense-and-us-monetary-policy">
Macro Musing podcast with Hendrickson</a> discusses this too.
It is not a coincidence that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution">
first article of the US Constitution</a> gave the 
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_the_purse">power of purse</a>" to the House (more on that later), 
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origination_Clause">
most representative part of the federal government</a>. Even taking one step back, part of the reason the Articles 
of Confederation failed was because the 
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/29nz63/why_didnt_the_articles_of_confederation_work/">
national government couldn't tax effectively</a>, in addition to trade and treaty problems, and a toothless executive.
The interesting thing to me is that most people do not live under one government; they live under multiple levels of government. 
The United States is a federal republic, meaning a federation with states (or regions) who have constitutional authority 
separate from the national government, and that all government officials are elected or chosen by elected politicians.
More generally, the reasons that people want federalism is one of three reasons as far as I can tell: 
ideological views that decentralization is just and the best way to do things (also called subsidiarity),
decentralization allows heterogeneity and experimentation and leads to the best outcomes 
by allowing different policies in different places 
(and by reducing political conflict by taking some issues off the table of national politics),
and as a compromise between the central government and the regional governments.
Since the United States is a federal republic, where states have a tremendous amount of power, 
it seems obvious that the taxing and spending powers of states are very important.
I believe the reasons for federalism are at odds in the United States system of federalism 
because federalism as practiced today in the United States doesn't really fulfill any of these aims.
Moreover, I think the root of many of the reasons federalism doesn't work as intended is 
because of taxation and spending policies, as practiced. I don't see any reason you cannot make this better, 
but it would require significant federal legislation and a significant increase in state action. This does not necessarily
mean constitutional changes, but that should be considered if you want to reinvigorate federalism. 
I will talk more about consitutional amendments later or in a separate article.

I think most Americans think we are very federal, 
but I would argue that the United States is not as decentralized (fiscally) as most Americans think.
subcentral spending taxes grants analysis, 
tax system (and some spending) is not coordinated at all,
no clear division of responsiblity, which leads to undermining and lack of flexibility.
We don't try to equalize state wealth

Probably want to mention Stuck by David Schleicher and why macroeconomic governance is hard in our federalist arrangement.
Also there are some problems with states as shown in Vermont is a Constitutional Problem by David Schleicher. 
talk about grants (block and equalizing) revenue sharing and own taxes 
Why are states unequal? What forces influence this? (clustering, regulations, mobility)
Robert Manduca argues that

Basic research on fiscal federalism, benefit principle, one policy one sovereign principle, 
When governments levy excise taxes, the taxes revenue <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/excise-taxes-excise-tax-trends">
should be used to fund the cost you are trying to internailze</a>. (There is an addtional reason, 
which is that excise tax revenue tends to be volatile and should not be relied on for general revenue.)
This is why gasoline tax revenue is generally used to fund infrastructure, (see the Highway Trust Fund, and more on that later), 
and why cigarette taxes are used to fund the health system in some way. 
(<a href="https://healthsystemsfacts.org/france/france-health-system-financing/">France does this</a> and so does 
<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11941">the United States</a>.)

Because many countries face similar questions of how to assign taxation and spending to their different levels of government,
I thought I would look at some other rich countries to see how they deal with these questions. There is a wide variety 
across countries, with some focusing more power in the central government, others, allow significant subcentral taxation 
and spending, and others rely mostly on grants, and almost every combiniation in between. Different policy areas are 
also handled by different levels of government, while some countries have more levels of government than others. 
One case that is worth considering is Sweden. Sweden is not a federal country but is highly decentralized.
In Sweden the main source of revenue for counties and municipalities is a 
<a href="https://sweden.se/life/society/taxes-in-sweden">flat income tax, with a combined average rate of 32%</a>,
although there is an earned income tax credit and deductions for seniors to lower the effective rate for low income indidvuals. 
Because people would prefer to pay less income taxes, the local governments are under pressure to use tax revenue very efficiently,
both to lower taxes, but also draw in residents from nearby. The national government levies payroll and social security taxes,
a flat income tax for high income individuals, and a VAT and many excise taxes. On the spending side, 
<a href="https://skr.se/tjanster/kommunerochregioner/faktakommunerochregioner/regionernasataganden.27748.html">regions</a> 
mainly handle health care, some dental care, 
public transportation, and economic development. The 
<a href="https://www.ccre.org/img/uploads/piecesjointe/filename/CEMR_structures_and_competences_2016_EN.pdf">municipalities</a> 
handle everything from schools, social services, elderly care, sanitation, and child care and many other tasks. 
Germany is a proper federation. Germany's constitution explicitly defines the federalism relations, by laying
out tasks for the federal government, state governments, and which powers are shared. While Sweden centers subnational government 
on local governments levies income taxes for their competences, Germany does a mix of revenue sharing, grants and own taxes.
Value added taxes, corporate taxes, income taxes are the same everywhere in Germany, 
and the revenues of each are <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemeinschaftsteuer_(Deutschland)">split 
in predetermined ratios</a> between the federal government, state governments, and municipal governments. Most excise tax 
revenue remains with the federal government, but states recieve inheritance tax revenue and property transfer taxes. 
The value added tax revenue is one of the main equalizing mechanisms, 
along with grants for the three city-states, grants taking into account the tax revenues of the local governments, 
grants for the former East German States , and other among

Themen/Oeffentliche_Finanzen/Foederale_Finanzbeziehungen/Laenderfinanzausgleich/Eng-Der-Bundesstaatliche-FAG.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=3">
other reasons</a>. There are also some cool things about local government financing, that I am not going to get into here
Once all of the tax revenue is distributed, the states can spend money however they want. Bavaria was the last to abolish
university tuition. 
For exmaple some states are increasing the minimum salaries of teachers. Berlin spends money on its public transit.
Bavaria spends money on X. Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg is spending money rebuilding the main train station in its capital Stuttgart.

Canada, 
Switzerland, and 
Belgium deal with decentralized decisions
</p>
<p>
convert all grant programs into per capita grants 
minimize conditions on grants and unfunded mandates
Copy Canada Equalization grants and Health and Social Transfer 
Have to talk about federalism health and transportation
Get rid of mortgage interest deduction and SALT deduction
Enact VAT and use all revenue to equalize states, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_services_tax_(Australia)">like Australia</a>, or use for social spending, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_VAT">like the Social VAT in France</a>.
(have the broadest base possible, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_Services_Tax_(New_Zealand)">
like New Zealand</a>)
After all the <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/89cd0319-en.pd">
OECD recommended the United States adopt a VAT in 2020</a>. 
(create incentives to phase out sales taxes) 
(alternatively use to bolster social insurance like the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_VAT">social VAT in France</a>) 
Do Canada style income taxes, with corporate tax integration via tax imputation credits
tax capital gains as ordinary income (50 discount?). 
Standardize income tax base (go broad, all economists say so, tax imputed rents like Denmark and Switzerland). 
(Once we have standardized income and payroll taxes do Canada CRA for state tax collection too.) 
More excise tax revenue should be left to states, like in Germany. 
Lottery and gambling revenue should go the level that takes the lead on tackling addiction problems.  
Gift estate and inheritance taxes go to states in Germany. 
I think I prefer to put this revenue into equalization or grant funds because
richer states and regions will have larger inheritances so this will help distribute wealth broadly.
Not like this matters much anyway because this revenue is very small in the US. 
(We could focus more on <a href="https://www.taxjusticenow.com">stopping evasion</a>, 
or lowering threshold or raising the tax rate.
Centralize Medicaid, 
unemployment insurance (good for when regional economies have idiosyncratic declines, or a national recession)
sick pay, 
do universal child benefits(becausegives more money to states with more children who canât work and thus have no taxable income)
put all state and local government employees in Social Security
In the longer run, I think enough states will get to a consensus push all health insurance to the national OR state level.
Basically Canada or France or the Netherlands or Switzerland (don't think anyone or any state is going to do the

Fiscal Federalism and Its Discontents

"I hate paying taxes. But I love the civilization they give me." -

<p>Taxes are the fundamental power of the state. States cannot do anything without tax revenue. 
Taxes seem to have

developed with civilization</a>. 
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/history-of-taxes/">The Rosetta Stone is mostly a tax document. </a>
One of the primary functions of states historically was defense, funded by taxes. Hendrickson, Slater, and Albrecht have a paper on this, 
called 
<a href="https://scholars.ttu.edu/en/publications/preventing-plunder-military-technology-capital-accumulation-and-e">Preventing Plunder</a>.

It is not a coincidence that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution">
first article of the US Constitution</a> gave the 
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_the_purse">power of purse</a>" to the House of Representatives (more on that later),

Rebellion</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The interesting thing to me is that most people do not live under one government; they live under multiple levels of government. 
The United States is a federal republic, meaning a federation with states (or regions) who have constitutional authority 
separate from the national government, and that all government officials are elected or chosen by elected politicians.
</p>
<p>
There are many reasons that federalism is desired, but it seems that it is one of three reasons as far as I can tell: 
ideological views that decentralization is just and the best way to do things (also called subsidiarity),
decentralization allows heterogeneity and experimentation to adapt to local preferences 
(and by reducing political conflict by taking some issues off the table of national politics),
and as a compromise between the central government and the regional governments. 
Unfortunately, I believe the reasons for federalism are at odds in the United States system of federalism 
because federalism as practiced today in the United States doesn't really fulfill any of these aims.
Moreover, I think the root of many of the reasons federalism doesn't work as intended is partly 
because of taxation and spending policies, as practiced, and coordination problems between states. 
I don't see any reason you cannot make this better, 
but it would require significant federal legislation and a significant increase in state action, 
coupled with a shift in how Americans think about state government or state democracy. This does not necessarily
mean constitutional changes, but that should be considered if you want to reinvigorate federalism. 
I will talk more about consitutional amendments later or in a separate article. 
Throughout this article, in the back of my mind, I am thinking about social insurance, marijuana, 
and the problem of housing and land use. 
I also grew up in a small town in a rural farming county with manufacturing and government employment anchoring the county,
so I am also thinking about small towns where scale is just not a thing to take advantage of. At the same time, 
it is very beneficial to take advantage of large cities and the agglomeration effects they generate and are shaped by.
</p>
<p>
Since the United States is a federal republic, where states have a tremendous amount of power, 
and that taxation is one of the core features of a state (the abstract idea of a state, not subdivision of administration), 
it seems obvious that the taxing and spending powers of states are very important. But I also think that this more 
downstream of how state government works in practice today, from issues of constitutional design, 
to assumptions about state democracy being stuck in the past, and lack of imagination. 
</p>
<h3>Institutions of Federalism</h3>
<p>
I was thinking about federalism because certain people like federalism but almost no one seems actually care 
across a variety of domains. Federalism is the system that states can do stuff and have their own sovreignty and legitimacy, 
regardless of national politics, only limited by the national and state constitutions. 
Even though I got interested in federalism as a way to solve major problems, 
this really is irrelevant to federalism as a core political philosophical commitment. 
The first thing to say is that for federalism to work properly, it must be democratic. In this vein, 
gerrymandering is extremely bad for state governments. 
I also strongly urge state governments to move to proportional representation. Open lists or 
mixed-member proportional representation is preferred. It doesn't really matter which because they are both easy to explain. 
(I know STV exists and might be better in theory, but I think it will be too complicated 
for too many people, creating unnecessary opposition to change or straight up fearmongering by opponents. I don't think 
this is actually a valid point because Australia and Ireland are just fine using STV. Also hard to do in a time of deep 
polarization and lower trust.) 
Also, unicameral state parliaments would be better than status quo of bicameral state legislatures (except Nebraksa) and 
separate elections for multiple state executive offices. (Even Italy, which separately elects its regional executive,
still only elects the equivalent of the governor, which would be an improvement.)
</p>
<p>
So besides the dysfunctional in the twenty first century institutions, we also have a mess of fiscal powers. 
I think most Americans think America is very federal, 
but I would argue that the United States is not as decentralized (at least fiscally) as most Americans think. 
Switzerland or Belgium or Canada is probably closer to what people mean and want by federalism, but more on that later. 
So, if you want a decentralized government, you have to fund the subcentral governments, or at least allow the 
sub central governments to fund themselves. This can be done 
via subcentral governments collect their own taxes, giving them grants, or a mix of both. 
So let's look at taxes and grants in some other countries.
</p>
<p>
<iframe width='100%' height='960' frameBorder='0' src='https://www.compareyourcountry.org/subnational-government-finance-and-investment/en/3/1244+1245+1246+1247/default/all/DEU+CHE+SWE+DNK+GBR+USA+CAN+AUS+AUT+ESP+ITA+FRA+BEL+NOR+FIN+NZL+JPN+IRL+USA'></iframe>
</p>
<p>
I find this interesting, but some of this is correlated with how much a country taxes in general.
So let's look at subcentral taxes compared to central government taxes, using the OECD Tax Database.
The central government measure includes social security contributions, 
which you could argue is just moving money around in the form of health insurance, pensions, etc. 
This is can be misleading because different countries fund these things with these contributions 
and others use general funds to fund the same things. 
So if you remove the social security contributions, you still end up with kind of the same result. 
There is also this helpful document from the OECD that tries to 
<a href="https://www.oecd.org/tax/federalism/spending-autonomy-of-sub-central-governments-conceptualisation-and-measurement-background-paper.pdf">
incorporate many different measures of subcentral government autonomy</a>. 
This mostly lines up with what I expected, although Finland and the United Kingdom scored higher than I expected 
in some areas, and it doesn't include the United States. 
</p>
<p>
So looking at this data, it seem clear to me if you actually cared about federalism, you should focus on more 
fiscal decentralization. Either slowly giving more taxation to states (and implicitly local governments), or more 
unconditional grants. This is not as easy as it sounds because of unequal fiscal capacities and crises that may arise. 
</p>
<h3>Regional Inequality</h3>
<p>
In the United States, states have very different taxing capabilities. This means that some states will find it much 
easier to raise an addition $100 per capita, but also some states will have it easier to raise $1000000 because they have 
more people to spread that cost around onto. This, I think, is one thing that really needs to be improved if you 
support federalism. My prefered approach is two sets of grants, the first based on pure equalization, and the second 
based on need. This implies more money to poorer states, 
but probably more money for states that have more children in school, or more money for elderly services, for example, 
all else equal. There are some more things you can take into account, like how rural or urban states are, as in Switzerland. 
</p>
<p>
I think it is worth providing context on why states should be equalized in the first place. To start with, 
different states have different economies with different sectors. For example, midwestern states have a lot of agriculture, 
Pennsylvania and North Dakota do a lot of fracking. Massachusetts has a large biomedical and education sector. 
To the extent the economy evolves over time, you would expect different sectors to become the new booming sector and 
other sectors of the economy to slump. Across the entire country, it should even out and in total we should get richer 
as the entire economy gets richer and evolves more towards the growth sectors. But this is bad for places 
disproportionally in the slumping sectors. 
So what should the federal government or state governments do? State governments can try to save money for a slumping time,
but if the sectors they are most reliant on go into permenant decline this isn't going to help in the long run. 
So one thing the federal government can do is just general redistribution from richer states to poorer states, 
with unconditional grants based purely on whether the state has below average income. The other that it can do 
is facilitate retraining probably in cooperation with state or local governments. Beefing up unemployment insurance 
would also be a good way to help insure against recessions and facilitate structural change as needed. 
But state governments can also make it easier for people to move into their state by reducing occupational licensing laws 
and loosening land regulation to allow more housing construction. This does create additional problems though. 
For example, if people are moving with their children, 
then those states now have to spend more on schools in the short run, even though it will probably pay off 
in the long run. This is why it would be good to have need based grants as well. The flip side is that Florida has 
unusually many retirees, which means Florida is getting so much Social Security money. But any elderly services are going 
to disproportionally burden Florida. These are just two examples of needs that probably should be considered 
when designing grants to states. 
</p>
<p>
The other big reason to have grants to states is that states experience idiosyncratic shocks or occasionally the entire country 
is in a recession. For idiosyncratic shocks, the same things for structural sectoral change apply. For generic recessions 
it would be helpful for the federal government to borrow billions of dollars and just give the money to states 
so they don't start cutting spending, meaning more layoffs and unemployed people in their state, which hurts 
state administrative capacity and makes the recession worse.

the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/state-and-local-budgets-and-the-great-recession/">2008 crisis</a>. 
Alex Williams also wrote about how states are assumed to be able to save for bad times, but the justifications are kind of 
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349033690_Moral_hazard_in_a_modern_federation">weak</a> 
because states don't really have that much control over the business cycle, and that is especially true 
when you consider the heterogenous composition of state economies and monetary policy being national. Also, the national 
politicians and state politicians benefit (or are harmed) differently from implementation of austerity. He proposed 
<a href="https://www.employamerica.org/researchreports/structuring-federal-aid-to-states-as-an-automatic-and-autonomous-stabilizer/">creating 
a fund</a> that will pay out to states based on previous years' tax revenues as their unemployment rate rises. 
This is because state and local tax revenues are procyclical. The Tax Policy Center also has a 
<a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/congress-can-help-state-and-local-governments-prepare-rainy-day-without-repealing-salt-cap">similar 
idea</a> even though it doesn't seem adequate enough to me and it is a better use of the SALT deduction than the status quo. 
Either way, these proposals mean states that tax more before a recession will get more money than those that tax less, 
so it doesn't change states's incentives to tax more or less, or give states a windfall, 
but still gives them a more stable budget over time so they can plan investments better. 
The United States could also adopt a VAT (more on this later) and use the some of the revenue to equalize state budgets, 
and in a recession give the states more revenue out of the total, like in Germany. 
</p>
<p>Related to recessions and borrowing is the fact that the United States government makes its own currency.
This means it can implement monetary policy to affect its borrowing costs. States cannot do this. 
There is a whole literature in economics about whether the United States (or any country or set of countries really) 
about whether different places should have the same currency, called an optimal currency area. Robert Mundell 
was the main founder of this line of research. Basically the conditions for having the same currency include 
workers being able and willing to move from slumping areas to booming areas, allowing investments freely across the area 
with the same currency, allowing wages and/or prices to adjust as needed, 
built in insurance mechanisms to help subregions through idosyncratic shocks, and generally similar business 
cycles.

<h3>Principles of taxation and fiscal federalism</h3>
<p>
Now I get to talk about the real thing I wanted to talk about, which is fiscal federalism.
This refers to how sub national governments finance their expenditures, but also includes which levels of government 
are doing what. Maybe the most important thing to say is that than direct taxation and spending is limited by 
the ability to set the terms of spending and who is supposed to do what. And this relationship of control 
is very hard to manage. You could just do everything with direct grants, which gives subcentral governments 
the power of spending (not talking about any conditions for the grants which reduces this power even further), 
but are still implicitly controlled by the higher levels of government. Or you could do the flip side 
and let every subnational government do what they want and have no involvement from the higher levels of government.
There are reasons to think you want a mix, which I will get into in a moment. 
What I mean is that in other countries, (that I will talk about later), it is very clear who manages health spending, education, 
transportation, housing, and law enforcement, and this is key, how they are supposed to fund those things.
Unfortunately, state and federal policy can work against each other (see Medicaid and marijuana), 
which I don't really think is federalism. 
I guess you could say the subnational government is doing what it wants, 
even if their constituents want it and there are bad incentives,
but in that case it seems like you should reset the federal and regional powers, not work against each other. 
(For Medicaid specifically, you really would need to put health fully in the hands of states, like in Canada, or 
put it fully in the federal government, like in most other countries.) 
The tax system (and some spending) is not coordinated at all in the United States.
Lastly, we don't try to equalize state wealth, which inherently makes federalism harder for some states, 
which I think undermines federalism for all states.
</p>
<p>
For tax policy, it is important to use sound taxation principles. The tax side should therefore be designed with
federalism (or decentralization generally) in mind. See <a href="guidetotaxation">this for more on good taxation 
principles</a>. Additionally, the 
<a href="https://www.mef.gov.it/primo-piano/documenti/24716_all-4-fiscal_federalism_oecd.pdf">Italian Finance Ministry</a> 
says that subcentral governments are good at aligning to local preferences, they are more democratically accountable, 
have better incentives for growth, but you have to take into account spillovers, scale, and crises that
hamper local governments. The OECD also has a nice report called 
<a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/89cd0319-en.pdf">Synthesising Good Practices in Fiscal Federalism</a>. 
In this report they say there are three categories of recommendations. The first is to 
align subcentral taxation to subcentral spending via increasing tax autonomy and owns resource revenues, 
and increase equalization.  
The second is to clearly give certain repsonsiblities to each level of government (one policy, one sovereign principle).
For example, Germany and Canada explicitly say in their constitutions what is and isn't subnational jurisdiction.
The third category is to make coordination easier by removing internal barriers to market integration (zoning 
and occupational licensing for example), increase transparency on taxation and spending,  
coordinate procurement for subcentral governments, and create incentives to coordinate for certain policies 
that have large spillovers (positive or negative) or could result in different levels of government working against each other. 
This is related to the benefit principle, which says the level of government that will benefit from investments 
should be responsible for funding those investments. Related to the benefit principle is the concept of spillovers. 
(For example, if one state spends a lot of money on universities, it may be hard to capture the aggregate benefits from that spending, 
especially if the graduates are likely to leave the state. The reverse situation is if a state approves a factory 
or power plant whose pollution mostly flows over the border to a neighboring state. Given the high returns to university spending 
and the very high costs of pollution, we probably want to fund more universities and allow less polluting factories, 
but getting the legal and taxing powers right can be difficult.) 
Tax base mobility is also important because if you make lower levels of government dependent on mobile tax bases, 
like corporate taxes, you will heavily incentivize corporations to move to the lowest tax jurisdiction, and will recieve 
less overall revenue (look at Germany or Swizterland). This means that more mobile tax bases should be taxed by 
higher levels of government. 
The other issue to consider with tax bases is how much the tax base changes year to year. Consumption tax revenue 
and payroll tax revenue do not change much year to year,
where as corporate tax revenue and alcohol taxes can change dramatically, year to year. 
This means we don't want local governments to be too reliant on one source of (volatile) tax revenue. 
</p>
<h3>International comparisons</h3>
<p>
Because many countries face similar questions of how to assign taxation and spending to their different levels of government,
I thought I would look at some other rich countries to see how they deal with these questions. There is a wide variety 
across countries, with some focusing more power in the central government, others, allow significant subcentral taxation 
and spending, and others rely mostly on grants, and almost every combiniation in between. Different policy areas are 
also handled by different levels of government, while some countries have more levels of government than others. 
</p>
<p>
One case that is worth considering is Sweden. Sweden is not a federal country but is highly decentralized.
In Sweden the main source of revenue for counties and municipalities is a 
<a href="https://sweden.se/life/society/taxes-in-sweden">flat income tax, with a combined average rate of 32%</a>,
although there is an earned income tax credit and deductions for seniors to lower the effective rate for low income indidvuals. 
Because people would prefer to pay less income taxes, the local governments are under pressure to use tax revenue very efficiently,
both to lower taxes, but also draw in residents from nearby, growing the tax base. 
The national government levies payroll and social security taxes,
a flat income tax for high income individuals, and a VAT and many excise taxes. On the spending side, 
<a href="https://skr.se/tjanster/kommunerochregioner/faktakommunerochregioner/regionernasataganden.27748.html">regions</a> 
mainly handle health care, some dental care, public transportation, and economic development. The 
<a href="https://www.ccre.org/img/uploads/piecesjointe/filename/CEMR_structures_and_competences_2016_EN.pdf">municipalities</a> 
handle everything from schools to social services and elderly care, to sanitation and child care and many other tasks. 
</p>
<p>
Germany is a proper federation. Germany's constitution explicitly defines the federalism relations, by laying
out tasks for the federal government, state governments, and which powers are shared. While Sweden has  
local governments that raise income taxes, Germany does a mix of revenue sharing, grants and own taxes.
and the revenues of each are <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemeinschaftsteuer_(Deutschland)">split 
in predetermined ratios</a> between the federal government, state governments, and municipal governments. Most excise tax 
revenue remains with the federal government, but states recieve inheritance tax revenue and property transfer taxes. 
The value added tax revenue is one of the main equalizing mechanisms, 
along with grants for the three city-states, grants taking into account the tax revenues of the local governments, 
grants for the former East German States, and for 
<a href="https://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Content/DE/Standardartikel/
Themen/Oeffentliche_Finanzen/Foederale_Finanzbeziehungen/Laenderfinanzausgleich/
Eng-Der-Bundesstaatliche-FAG.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=3">
for other reasons</a>. There are also some cool things about local government financing, that I am not going to get into here. 
This complicated system of grants does three things. The first is that over eighty percent of taxes are the same no matter 
where you live, meaning states and local governments have to lure people and business on other dimensions, 
<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gewerbesteuer_(Deutschland)">mostly</a> 
<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grundsteuer_(Deutschland)">preventing</a> a race to the bottom on taxes. 
This system of grants also ensures that Germans have basically the same 
<a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/seminar/2000/fiscal/spahn.pdf">level of public goods and services
no matter where they live</a>. And thirdly, it give state and local governments incentives to grow their populations and do economic development,
because they automatically get more tax revenue from population growth and by their residents getting richer. 
</p>
<p>
Canada takes a different approach from Germany. The Canadian federal government has a progressive income tax, corporate tax, and 
value added tax (called a Goods and Services Tax). Instead of splitting the revenue like in Germany, 
the provinces levy their own taxes on top of the federal taxes,
known as piggybacking, with the provinces deciding the corporate and income tax rates and brackets, 
and whether to have a value added tax or sales tax and how high of a rate. 
Canada also allows provinces to outsource most tax collection to the Canadian tax enforcement agency, the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Revenue_Agency">Canada Revenue Agency</a>.
Like Germany, Canada gives <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/programs/federal-transfers/equalization.html">
equalization grants to poorer provinces</a>, but Canada also has two other funds called the 
<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/programs/federal-transfers/canada-health-transfer.html">
Canadian Health Transfer</a>,and the 
<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/programs/federal-transfers/canada-social-transfer.html">
Canadian Social Transfer</a>. These are both given to provinces on a per capita basis, are going to grow at least 3% for the next several years, 
meaning that provinces can plan around recieving these funds for several years. (The provinces can be penalized for inadequate 
social services, but have never been penalized for doing so. The penalities for the CHT have been applied, but were paid later for fixing
the problems.) The CHT is to support the health systems of each province, while the CST support education, social services, elderly care etc. 
These two transfers were created by 
<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/programs/federal-transfers/history-health-social-transfers.html">consolidating</a>  
other grants and cost sharing programs, and funds have changed to be more flexible and to rely more on public 
accountability instead of federal government oversight. 
One key thing to note about Canada's system is that the Constitution of Canada clearly delegates 
</p>
<p>
Although Belgium is quite decentralized on policy and spending, most taxation is still done centrally. 
This is complicated by the fact that Belgium has regions and communities. Short story on this is that communities are based around 
language, education, and "things dealing with the person", while regions are geographic areas, focused more on economic policy. 
Communities rely mostly on grants, but regions recieve grants and levy some taxes. 
Belgium is an interesting case of federalism because they only became a federation in 1993. 
This is mainly because they keep having government crises every decade or so since 1970, 
and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_reform_in_Belgium">resolution</a>
is giving more authority to the regional or community governments.

Subnational governments levy property taxes too</a>  
In Belgium the federal government collects most tax revenue through income, payroll, VATs, and other taxes. 
The federal government has

The subnational governments collectly only <a href="https://www.sng-wofi.org/country-profiles/Fiche%20BELGIUM.pdf">
levy about a quarter of their expenditures</a>, mainly from a flat income tax on top of the nation income tax and some 
fees and tariffs. 
This is while subnational governments do about half of all government expenditure and employ about 80% of government employees. 
(The <a href="https://www.oecd.org/belgium/45198474.pdf">OECD thinks that Belgium</a> should have

Switzerland definitely has a very federal government.
While Canada gives large autonomy to provinces, Switzerland's cantons go even further. 
The national Swiss government 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_Switzerland">levies a VAT that is only 7.7 percent</a>, 
which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_value_added_tax">basically the lowest in Europe</a>. 
The national government does levy corporate and income taxes, but not that much as a percent of GDP. The real action on taxation in 
Switzerland is cantonal and municipal. Both derive large amounts of revenue from income and corporate taxes. 
This has led to tax competition with low tax rates and efficient spending, or at least lower spending. (source) 
Even though they are very decentralized, the Swiss do have a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_security_in_Switzerland">national social security system</a>, 
not too different from the United States, 
but much more comprehensive. (<a href="https://www.ahv-iv.ch/en/Social-insurances/Family-allowance-FZ">
Some cantons even have additional child benefits</a> above the national ones.) 
They also do <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-92381-9_17">equalization, but asymmetrically</a>; 
they focus on bringin up the poorest cantons to the average, 
while letting the richer cantons just pay some money into the equalizaiton scheme. 
This does seems like it would lower incentives for the poorer cantons to increase their wealth  
because they lose quite a bit from equalization as they get closer to average wealth. 
Most of the equalization is still done by the federal government giving money to poorer cantons.
The federal government does give grants based on costs, notablely giving more money to city-cantons and mountainous cantons.  
Here is more (probably outdated) 
<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/Event/ECA/Poland/pl-fiscal-equalization-bernard-dafflon.pdf">information 
on Swiss equalization</a>.
The cantons and municipalities do still have large incentives to increase their populations because they automatically get the tax revenue from 
new residents and corporations, not unlike Sweden. Because the cantons do their own thing, it is very hard to charactarize what the cantons 
(and municipalities) do of their own volition. Swiss cantons can even 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantons_of_Switzerland">make treaties with other cantons and other countries</a>! 
All cantons and some municipalities have their own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_Switzerland">police</a>, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Switzerland#">education is almost exclusively cantonal 
except for the two federal universities</a>, and the cantons set their own 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantons_of_Switzerland">official language</a>. 
<a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/international-health-policy-center/countries/switzerland">Health care in Switzerland</a> 
is considered one of the best and is somewhat managed at the national level, 
but also at the cantonal level, with municipalities doing some long term care too. 
There is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Federal_Railways">national railway company</a>, 
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock-face_scheduling">nationwide rail integration</a>. 
It is usually considered the best or one of the best rail systems in the world, 
despite Swiss decentralization and the complexity required to build and maintain tracks, and coordinate all the schedules. 
Switzerland does really seem to be like what people think when they think about what federalism means.

<h3>If you care about federalism, you should do X</h3>

<a href="https://www.oecd.org/cfe/regionaldevelopment/Conditioning-Intergovernmental-Transfers-paper.pdf">More on coordination 
and potential problems and solutions</a>. 
<a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/dd7e2820-en/index.html?itemId=/content/component/dd7e2820-en">OECD recommends</a> 
tackling land use regulations, more coordination of transportation, reducing occupational licensing, among other things. 
Fold as many grant programs into per capita grants a la CHT and CST. 
Minimize conditions on grants and unfunded mandates. 
Copy Canada Equalization grants and Social Transfer (and maybe CHT, more on that in a moment). 
<a href="http://dolanecon.blogspot.com/2017/01/who-benefits-from-mortgage-interest.html">Get rid of mortgage interest deduction</a> 
and SALT deduction. Another 
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1051137722000602?fr=RR-1&ref=cra_js_challenge">paper 
by Dawkins</a> finding similar things, where tax deductions exarcerbate geographic ineuqality. Interestingly,
he also notes that reversing the TJCA would make this problem worse. 
Have to talk about federalism health and transportation. 
Enact VAT (and cut federal income taxes slightly) and use all revenue to equalize states, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_services_tax_(Australia)">like Australia</a>, or use for social spending, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_VAT">like the Social VAT in France</a>.
(Have the broadest base possible, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_Services_Tax_(New_Zealand)">
like New Zealand</a>). 
After all the <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/89cd0319-en.pd">
OECD recommended the United States adopt a VAT in 2020</a>. 
(Create incentives to phase out sales taxes, probably done by giving states all or most VAT revenue.) 
I would say the United States should take Inspiration from Switzerland and Canada.
Have the federal government define income tax bases (all types of income from all sources),
and make the bases broad, all economists say, so tax imputed rents like Denmark and Switzerland.
and let states add on their own income taxes.  
(Similar thing for corporate taxes, but probably want to impute dividends.)
(Once we have standardized income and payroll taxes do Canada CRA for state tax collection too.) 
Switzerland handles social insurance well, but making unemployment insurance quite local, with national pensions, 
disability, and child benefits, and cantons can add on to these if they want. 
Change all the tax credits to be an improved EITC and put all child based tax provisions into a universal child benefit.
This is also what Canada does. See below for health insurance. 
More excise tax revenue should be left to states, like in Germany, (unless the federal government is going to 
tackle the problems you are trying to fix with the excise taxes). 
Lottery and gambling revenue should go the level that takes the lead on tackling addiction problems.  
I think I prefer to put gift and inheritance tax revenue into equalization or grant funds because
richer states and regions will have larger inheritances so this will help distribute wealth broadly.
Not like this matters much anyway because this revenue is very small in the US (see OECD Tax Stats code 4300). 
(We could focus more on <a href="https://www.taxjusticenow.com">stopping evasion</a>, 
or lowering threshold or raising the tax rate).
The United States should also centralize its social insurance to better distribute income. Centralize 
unemployment insurance (good for when regional economies have idiosyncratic declines, or a national recession), 
sick pay and parental leave (one of the things lacking to support parents), and do universal child benefits
(because 
<a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/report-measuring-the-child-tax-credits-economic-and-community-impact/">
it gives more money to states and regions with more children</a> 
and children can't work and thus have no taxable income),
put all state and local government employees in Social Security (and give incentives to do so if necessary). 
Now to deal with health insurance. It frustrates me to no end that health insurance in the United States is so bad.
We spend so much money and have worse life expectancy. (Maybe I will make another post on this later).
In the longer run, I think enough states will get to a consensus push all health insurance to the national OR state level.
If states run health care (like in Canada), then copy Canada Health Transfer.
I think the better way to go is to expand Medicare to everyone. We should at least start by covering all children.
No reason we couldn't start lowering the eligibility age from 65 to something lower either. This will require 
higher taxes, This is literally what France, Germany, Belgium, Austria, and Japan (I am sure this is not an exhaustive list) 
do. Also, <a href="https://healthpolicynerd.substack.com/p/medicare-the-basics-of-design-coverage">a significant portion 
of Medicare funding now comes from general revenues or premiums</a>.
So some combination of higher payroll taxes (good for making immigrants contribute too!) or income taxes will work.
(Congress should probably offset some of the increased payroll taxes with higher tax credits of some kind, income taxes 
can be charged to whoever you want, although it would be better to expand the income tax base first.)
Basically one of Canada, France, or Switzerland (don't think anyone or any state is going to do the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beveridge_Model">Beveridge Model</a>.)

<h1>
Fiscal Federalism and Its Discontents
</h1>

"I hate paying taxes. But I love the civilization they give me." - 
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/123900-i-hate-paying-taxes-but-i-love-the-civilization-they">Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.</a></p> 
<p>Taxes are the fundamental power of the state. States cannot do anything without tax revenue. 
Taxes seem to have 
<a href="https://www.ajc.com/lifestyles/food--cooking/grains-tubers-and-the-fate-civilizations/HRS1ANbB6Hm4RZc3mlQgoK/">
developed with civilization</a>. 
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/history-of-taxes/">The Rosetta Stone is mostly a tax document. </a>
One of the primary functions of states historically was defense, funded by taxes. Hendrickson, Slater, and Albrecht have a paper on this, 
called 
<a href="https://scholars.ttu.edu/en/publications/preventing-plunder-military-technology-capital-accumulation-and-e">Preventing Plunder</a>. 
<a href="https://www.mercatus.org/bridge/podcasts/05162022/josh-hendrickson-economic-growth-national-defense-and-us-monetary-policy">
Macro Musing podcast with Hendrickson</a> discusses this too.
It is not a coincidence that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution">
first article of the US Constitution</a> gave the 
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_the_purse">power of purse</a>" to the House of Representatives (more on that later), 
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origination_Clause">
most representative part of the federal government</a>. Even taking one step back, part of the reason the Articles 
of Confederation failed was because the 
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/29nz63/why_didnt_the_articles_of_confederation_work/">
national government couldn't tax effectively</a>, in addition to trade and treaty problems, and a toothless executive, 
highlighted by 
<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/us-history/road-to-revolution/creating-a-nation/a/shayss-rebellion">Shay's 
Rebellion</a>. 
The interesting thing to me is that most people do not live under one government; they live under multiple levels of government. 
The United States is a federal republic, meaning a federation with states (or regions) who have constitutional authority 
separate from the national government, and that all government officials are elected or chosen by elected politicians.
More generally, the reasons that people want federalism is one of three reasons as far as I can tell: 
ideological views that decentralization is just and the best way to do things (also called subsidiarity),
decentralization allows heterogeneity and experimentation to adapt to local preferences 
(and by reducing political conflict by taking some issues off the table of national politics),
and as a compromise between the central government and the regional governments.
Since the United States is a federal republic, where states have a tremendous amount of power, 
it seems obvious that the taxing and spending powers of states are very important.
I believe the reasons for federalism are at odds in the United States system of federalism 
because federalism as practiced today in the United States doesn't really fulfill any of these aims.
Moreover, I think the root of many of the reasons federalism doesn't work as intended is partly 
because of taxation and spending policies, as practiced, and coordination problems between states. 
I don't see any reason you cannot make this better, 
but it would require significant federal legislation and a significant increase in state action, 
coupled with a shift in how Americans think about state government or state democracy. This does not necessarily
mean constitutional changes, but that should be considered if you want to reinvigorate federalism. 
I will talk more about consitutional amendments later or in a separate article. 
Throughout this article, in the back of my mind, I am thinking about social insurance, marijuana, and the problem of housing and land use. 
I also grew up in a small town in a rural farming county with manufacturing and government employment anchoring the county,
so I am also thinking about small towns where scale is just not a thing to take advantage of. At the same time, 
it is very beneficial to take advantage of large cities and the agglomeration effects they generate and are shaped by.
</p>
<h3>Institutions of Federalism</h3>
<p>
I was thinking about federalism because certain people like federalism but almost no one seems actually care 
across a variety of domains. Federalism is starting as states can do stuff and have their own sovreignty and legitimacy, 
regardless of national politics or policy outcomes. Even though I got interested in federalism as a way to solve major problems, 
this really is irrelevant to federalism as a core political philosophical commitment. 
The first thing to say is that for federalism to work properly, it must be democratic. In this vein, 
gerrymandering is extremely bad for state governments. 
Relatedly, off cycle elections are also bad, so the states that have state elections in odd years should move their elections 
by one year so they are at the same time as presidential or midterm elections. 
I also strongly urge state governments to move to proportional representation. Open lists or 
mixed-member proportional representation is preferred. It doesn't really matter, but they are both easy to explain 
compared to the status quo. (I know STV exists and might be better in theory, but I think it will be too complicated 
for too many people, creating unnecessary opposition to change or straight up fearmongering by opponents. I don't think 
this is actually a valid point because Australia and Ireland are just fine using STV. Also hard to do in a time of deep 
polarization and lower trust.) 
Also, unicameral state parliaments would be better than status quo of bicameral legislatures (except Nebraksa)
separate elections for state executive offices and the legislature. (Even Italy, which separately elects its regional executive,
still only elects the equivalent of the governor, which would be an improvement.)
</p>
<p>
Now on the federal government side of federalism, the federal government could be way more constructive by doing things 
with state heterogeneity in mind. This would take the form of more explicit state control, less constraining regulations and 
mandates, or lots of opt-outs or options built into laws, programs, and regulations. 
(Also,South Dakota v. Dole, which I think is wrong, not mention the SCOTUS cases over the ACA.)
</p>
<p>
Looking at other countries, I am surprised we don't have an instution where states can exert power 
within the federal government. Canada and Australia have councils of premiers where the 'governors' of each 
state/province and the prime minister/cabinet meet and work out agreements. Germany's 'upper chamber' is composed 
of members chosen entirely by state cabinets and must exercise their power together, but also get no say over non-state 
affairs. In the Netherlands, the upper chamber is chosen based on the provincial elections, but neither the chamber or provinces 
are particularly important. Belgium also has its upper chamber based of regional elections (that occur at the same time as 
the national elections) and then those senators choose another 10 senators. In the US, the closest we have to any of this is 
governors asking Congress or the executive branch nicely. Yes, the National Governor's association exists, but I can't tell 
if they have ever meaningfully done anything. In Australia, their council of state governments played a role in Covid policy.
In Canada, they have worked out numerous agreements over time and have even proposed amendments. In Germany they are constantly 
working to hammer deals, including a major reform in the early 2000s, but also talking through tax changes occassionally (probably 
due to Germany's tax sharing system, but still, that is a major deal that states directly influence.) 
</p>
<p>
I think most Americans think we are very federal, 
but I would argue that the United States is not as decentralized (fiscally) as most Americans think. 
Switzerland is probably closer to what people mean and want by federalism, but more on that later. 
So, if you want a decentralized government, you have to fund the subcentral governments, or ate least give the subcentral 
governments the ability to collect their own taxes. You can do this 
via taxes or grants. So let's look at  
<a href="https://www.compareyourcountry.org/subnational-government-finance-and-investment/en/3/1244+1245+1246+1247/default/all/DEU+CHE+SWE+DNK+GBR+USA+CAN+AUS+AUT+ESP+ITA+FRA+BEL+NOR+FIN+NZL+JPN+IRL+USA">taxes and grants in some other countries</a>.
<iframe width='100%' height='960' frameBorder='0' src='https://www.compareyourcountry.org/subnational-government-finance-and-investment/en/3/1244+1245+1246+1247/default/all/DEU+CHE+SWE+DNK+GBR+USA+CAN+AUS+AUT+ESP+ITA+FRA+BEL+NOR+FIN+NZL+JPN+IRL+USA'></iframe>
I find this interesting, but some of this is correlated with how much a country taxes in general.
So let's look at subcentral taxes compared to central government taxes, using the OECD Tax Database.
Now this includes social security contributions, which you could argue is just moving money around in the form 
of health insurance, pensions, etc. This is can be misleading because different countries fund these things with these contributions 
and others use general funds to fund the same things. 
So if you remove the social security contributions, you still end up with kind of the same result.
One more wrinkle to throw into this is the deprecated data set of sub central autonomy. This is a few years old, but interesting.
Taxation and spending are relatively autonomous in the United States, but keep in mind federal grant restrictions.
</p>
<h3>Regional Inequality</h3>
<p>
Probably want to mention Stuck by David Schleicher and why macroeconomic governance is hard in our federalist arrangement, 
including optimal currency areas.
Also there are some problems with states as shown in Vermont is a Constitutional Problem by David Schleicher. 
talk about grants (block and equalizing) revenue sharing and own taxes. 
Why are states unequal? What forces influence this? (clustering, regulations, mobility)
Robert Manduca argues that 
<a href="https://equitablegrowth.org/how-national-income-inequality-in-the-united-states-contributes-to-economic-disparities-between-regions/">
regional inequality is driven by inequality generally</a>. 
Marchand Dube and Breau <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/a/taf/recgxx/v96y2020i2p83-107.html">
seem to find that industry mix matters</a> for inequality too.

<h3>Principles of taxation and fiscal federalism</h3>

<p>
Now I get to talk about the real thing I wanted to talk about, which is fiscal federalism.
This refers to how sub national governments finance their expenditures, but also includes which levels of government 
are doing what. Maybe the most important thing to say is that than direct taxation and spending is limited by 
the ability to set the terms of spending and who is supposed to do what. And this relationship of control 
is very hard to manage. You could just do everything with direct grants, which gives subcentral governments 
the power of spending (not talking about any conditions for the grants which reduces this power even further), 
but are still implicitly controlled by the higher levels of government. Or you could do the flip side 
and let every subnational government do what they want and have no involvement from the higher levels of government.
There are reasons to think you want a mix, which I will get into in a moment. 
What I mean is that in other countries, (that I will talk about later), it is very clear who manages health spending, education, 
transportation, housing, and law enforcement, and this is key, how they are supposed to fund those things.
Unfortunately, state and federal policy can work against each other (see Medicaid), which really is not federalism at all. 
I guess you could say the subnational government is doing what it wants, even if their constituents want it and there are bad incentives,
but in that case it seems like you should reset the federal and regional powers, not work against each other. 
(For Medicaid specifically, you really would need to put health fully in the hands of states, like in Canda, or 
put it fully in the federal government, like in most other countries.) 
The tax system (and some spending) is not coordinated at all in the United States.
Lastly, we don't try to equalize state wealth, which inherently makes federalism harder for some states, 
which I think undermines federalism for all states.
</p>
<p>
For tax policy, it is important to use sound taxation principles. The tax side should therefore be designed with
federalism (or decentralization generally) in mind. The 
<a href="https://www.mef.gov.it/primo-piano/documenti/24716_all-4-fiscal_federalism_oecd.pdf">Italian Finance Ministry</a> 
says that subcentral governments are good at aligning to local preferences, they are more democratically accountable, 
have better incentives for growth, but you have to take into account spillovers, scale, and crises that
hamper local governments. 
The OECD also has a nice report called 
<a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/89cd0319-en.pdf">Synthesising Good Practices in Fiscal Federalism</a>. 
In this report they say there are three categories of recommendations. The first is to 
align subcentral taxation to subcentral spending via increasing tax autonomy and owns resource revenues, and increase equalization.  
The second is to clearly give certain repsonsiblities to each level of government (one policy, one sovereign principle). 
The third category is to make coordination easier by removing internal barriers to market integration, 
collect data, increase transperancy on taxation and spending, oversee local government performance, 
coordinate procurement for subcentral governments, and create incentives to coordinate for certain policies 
that have large spillovers (positive or negative) or could result in different governments working against each other. 
Also keep in mind the benefit principle, which says the level of government that will benefit from investments 
should be responsible for funding those investments. Related to the benefit principle is the concept of spillovers. 
(For example, if one state spends a lot of money on universities, it may be hard to capture the aggregate benefits from that spending, 
especially if the graduates are likely to leave the state. The reverse situation is if a state approves a factory 
or power plant whose pollution mostly flows over the border to a neighboring state. Given the high returns to university spending 
and the very high costs of pollution, we probably want to fund more universities and allow less polluting factories, 
but getting the legal and taxing powers right can be difficult.) 
Tax base mobility is also important because if you make lower levels of government dependent on mobile tax bases, 
like corporate taxes, you will heavily incentivize corporations to move to the lowest tax jurisdiction, and will recieve 
less overall revenue (look at Germany or Swizterland). This means that more mobile tax bases should be taxed by 
higher levels of government. 
The other issue to consider with tax bases is how much the tax base changes year to year. Consumption tax revenue 
and payroll tax revenue do not change much year to year,
where as corporate tax revenue can change dramatically, year to year. This means we don't want local governments to be too 
reliant on one source of tax revenue. 
</p>
<h3>International comparisons</h3>
<p>
Because many countries face similar questions of how to assign taxation and spending to their different levels of government,
I thought I would look at some other rich countries to see how they deal with these questions. There is a wide variety 
across countries, with some focusing more power in the central government, others, allow significant subcentral taxation 
and spending, and others rely mostly on grants, and almost every combiniation in between. Different policy areas are 
also handled by different levels of government, while some countries have more levels of government than others. 
</p>
<p>
One case that is worth considering is Sweden. Sweden is not a federal country but is highly decentralized.
In Sweden the main source of revenue for counties and municipalities is a 
<a href="https://sweden.se/life/society/taxes-in-sweden">flat income tax, with a combined average rate of 32%</a>,
although there is an earned income tax credit and deductions for seniors to lower the effective rate for low income indidvuals. 
Because people would prefer to pay less income taxes, the local governments are under pressure to use tax revenue very efficiently,
both to lower taxes, but also draw in residents from nearby, growing the tax base. 
The national government levies payroll and social security taxes,
a flat income tax for high income individuals, and a VAT and many excise taxes. On the spending side, 
<a href="https://skr.se/tjanster/kommunerochregioner/faktakommunerochregioner/regionernasataganden.27748.html">regions</a> 
mainly handle health care, some dental care, public transportation, and economic development. The 
<a href="https://www.ccre.org/img/uploads/piecesjointe/filename/CEMR_structures_and_competences_2016_EN.pdf">municipalities</a> 
handle everything from schools to social services and elderly care, to sanitation and child care and many other tasks. 
</p>
<p>
Germany is a proper federation. Germany's constitution explicitly defines the federalism relations, by laying
out tasks for the federal government, state governments, and which powers are shared. While Sweden has  
local governments that raise income taxes, Germany does a mix of revenue sharing, grants and own taxes.
and the revenues of each are <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemeinschaftsteuer_(Deutschland)">split 
in predetermined ratios</a> between the federal government, state governments, and municipal governments. Most excise tax 
revenue remains with the federal government, but states recieve inheritance tax revenue and property transfer taxes. 
The value added tax revenue is one of the main equalizing mechanisms, 
along with grants for the three city-states, grants taking into account the tax revenues of the local governments, 
grants for the former East German States, and for 
<a href="https://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Content/DE/Standardartikel/
Themen/Oeffentliche_Finanzen/Foederale_Finanzbeziehungen/Laenderfinanzausgleich/
Eng-Der-Bundesstaatliche-FAG.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=3">
for other reasons</a>. There are also some cool things about local government financing, that I am not going to get into here. 
This complicated system of grants does three things. The first is that over eighty percent of taxes are the same no matter 
where you live, meaning states and local governments have to lure people and business on other dimensions, 
<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gewerbesteuer_(Deutschland)">mostly</a> 
<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grundsteuer_(Deutschland)">preventing</a> a race to the bottom on taxes. 
This system of grants also ensures that Germans have basically the same 
<a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/seminar/2000/fiscal/spahn.pdf">level of public goods and services
no matter where they live</a>. And thirdly, it give state and local governments incentives to grow their populations and do economic development,
because they automatically get more tax revenue from population growth and by their residents getting richer. 
</p>
<p>
Canada takes a different approach from Germany. The Canadian federal government has a progressive income tax, corporate tax, and 
value added tax (called a Goods and Services Tax). Instead of splitting the revenue like in Germany, 
the provinces levy their own taxes on top of the federal taxes,
known as piggybacking, with the provinces deciding the corporate and income tax rates and brackets, 
and whether to have a value added tax or sales tax and how high of a rate. 
Canada also allows provinces to outsource most tax collection to the Canadian tax enforcement agency, the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Revenue_Agency">Canada Revenue Agency</a>.
Like Germany, Canada gives <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/programs/federal-transfers/equalization.html">
equalization grants to poorer provinces</a>, but Canada also has two other funds called the 
<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/programs/federal-transfers/canada-health-transfer.html">
Canadian Health Transfer</a>,and the 
<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/programs/federal-transfers/canada-social-transfer.html">
Canadian Social Transfer</a>. These are both given to provinces on a per capita basis, are going to grow at least 3% for the next several years, 
meaning that provinces can plan around recieving these funds for several years. (The provinces can be penalized for inadequate 
social services, but have never been penalized for doing so. The penalities for the CHT have been applied, but were paid later for fixing
the problems.) The CHT is to support the health systems of each province, while the CST support education, social services, elderly care etc. 
These two transfers were created by 
<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/programs/federal-transfers/history-health-social-transfers.html">consolidating</a>  
other grants and cost sharing programs, and funds have changed to be more flexible and to rely more on public 
accountability instead of federal government oversight. 
One key thing to note about Canada's system is that the Constitution of Canada clearly delegates 
</p>
<p>
Although Belgium is quite decntralized on policy and spending, most taxation is still done centrally. 
This is complicated by the fact that Belgium has regions and communities. Short story on this is that communities are based around 
language, education, and "things dealing with the person", while regions are geographic areas, focused more on economic policy. 
Communities rely mostly on grants, but regions recieve grants and levy some taxes. 
Belgium is an interesting case of federalism because they only became a federation in 1993. 
This is mainly because they keep having government crises every decade or so since 1970, 
and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_reform_in_Belgium">resolution</a>
is giving more authority to the regional or community governments. 
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communities,_regions_and_language_areas_of_Belgium">Regions</a> 
are based on geography, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communities,_regions_and_language_areas_of_Belgium">communities</a> 
are based on language and includes education and other things.) 
<a href="(https://www.belgium.be/en/about_belgium/government/regions/competence)">Regions manage</a> 
agriculture, regional development, transportation (not SNCB/NMBS), energy (nuclear energy is still federal), water policy, 
trade policy, management of local governments, and environmental policy. 
<a href="https://www.belgium.be/en/about_belgium/government/communities/competence">Communities</a>
manage arts, tourism, radio and television(including public broadcasters), language and education, libraries, 
some things related to health, youth, elderly, disability, and family policy. 
The <a href="https://www.belgium.be/en/about_belgium/government/federal_authorities/competence_federal_government">national government</a>
manages the military, foreign affairs, the judicial system, social security and other welfare state policies,

like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Railway_Company_of_Belgium">National Railway Company of Belgium</a>, 
and the things previously mentioned as federal government competencies. 
There are

equalization payments to the poorer regions</a>, and of course there are political tensions around this.
and the VAT is used for communities and social security.

This is information on taxes that go to regions and communities (and EU and social security) (sorry it is in French)</a>) 
<a href="https://www.belgium.be/fr/logement/achat_et_vente/precompte_immobilier/calcul">
Subnational governments levy property taxes too</a>  
In Belgium the federal government collects most tax revenue through income, payroll, VATs, and other taxes. 
The federal government has 
<a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/fiscal-federalism-in-belgium_218562648706">
most pension, health, and social security costs</a>. 
The federal government defines tax bases and the subnational governments controls more of property taxes and some other excise taxes.?
Belgium has <a href="https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/002/2003/050/article-A001-en.xml">fiscally decentralized</a>.
The subnational governments collectly only <a href="https://www.sng-wofi.org/country-profiles/Fiche%20BELGIUM.pdf">
levy about a quarter of their expenditures</a>, mainly from a flat income tax on top of the nation income tax and some fees and tariffs. 
This is while subnational governments do about half of all government expenditure and employ about 80% of government employees. 
</p>
<p>
Switzerland definitely has a very federal government.
While Canada gives large autonomy to provinces, Switzerland's cantons go even further. 
The national Swiss government 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_Switzerland">levies a VAT that is only 7.7 percent</a>, 
which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_value_added_tax">basically the lowest in Europe</a>. 
The national government does levy corporate and income taxes, but not that much as a percent of GDP. The real action on taxation in 
Switzerland is cantonal and municipal. Both derive large amounts of revenue from income and corporate taxes. 
This has led to tax competition with low tax rates and efficient spending, or at least lower spending. (source) 
Even though they are very decentralized, the Swiss do have a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_security_in_Switzerland">national social security system</a>, 
not too different from the United States, 
but much more comprehensive. (<a href="https://www.ahv-iv.ch/en/Social-insurances/Family-allowance-FZ">
Some cantons even have additional child benefits</a> above the national ones.) 
They also do <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-92381-9_17">equalization, but asymmetrically</a>; 
they focus on bringin up the poorest cantons to the average, 
while letting the richer cantons just pay some money into the equalizaiton scheme. 
This does seems like it would lower incentives for the poorer cantons to increase their wealth  
because they lose quite a bit from equalization as they get closer to average wealth. 
Most of the equalization is still done by the federal government giving money to poorer cantons.
The federal government does give grants based on costs, notablely giving more money to city-cantons and mountainous cantons.  
Here is more (probably outdated) 
<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/Event/ECA/Poland/pl-fiscal-equalization-bernard-dafflon.pdf">information 
on Swiss equalization</a>.
The cantons and municipalities do still have large incentives to increase their populations because they automatically get the tax revenue from 
new residents and corporations, not unlike Sweden. Because the cantons do their own thing, it is very hard to charactarize what the cantons 
(and municipalities) do of their own volition. Swiss cantons can even 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantons_of_Switzerland">make treaties with other cantons and other countries</a>! 
All cantons and some municipalities have their own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_Switzerland">police</a>, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Switzerland#">education is almost exclusively cantonal 
except for the two federal universities</a>, and the cantons set their own 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantons_of_Switzerland">official language</a>. 
<a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/international-health-policy-center/countries/switzerland">Health care in Switzerland</a> 
is considered one of the best and is somewhat managed at the national level, 
but also at the cantonal level, with municipalities doing some long term care too. 
There is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Federal_Railways">national railway company</a>, 
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock-face_scheduling">nationwide rail integration</a>. 
It is usually considered the best or one of the best rail systems in the world, 
despite Swiss decentralization and the complexity required to build and maintain tracks, and coordinate all the schedules. 
Switzerland does really seem to be like what people think when they think about what federalism means.

tackling land use regulations, more coordination of transportation, reducing occupational licensing, among other things. 
Fold as many grant programs into per capita grants a la CHT and CST. 
Minimize conditions on grants and unfunded mandates. 
Copy Canada Equalization grants and Social Transfer (and maybe CHT, more on that in a moment). 
<a href="http://dolanecon.blogspot.com/2017/01/who-benefits-from-mortgage-interest.html">Get rid of mortgage interest deduction</a> 
and SALT deduction. 
Have to talk about federalism health and transportation 
Enact VAT (and cut federal income taxes slightly) and use all revenue to equalize states, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_services_tax_(Australia)">like Australia</a>, or use for social spending, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_VAT">like the Social VAT in France</a>.
(have the broadest base possible, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_Services_Tax_(New_Zealand)">
like New Zealand</a>). 
After all the <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/89cd0319-en.pd">
OECD recommended the United States adopt a VAT in 2020</a>. 
(Create incentives to phase out sales taxes, probably done by giving states all or most VAT revenue.) 
Do Canada style income taxes, with corporate tax integration via tax imputation credits and 
tax capital gains as ordinary income  with a 50% discount. 
Actually don't do that. Ed Dolan and AusTaxPolicy show why.
You want to tax capital gains and dividends at the same rate, 
and tax the individuals, not the corporation. Dividend imputation or Sweden dual income tax.
Standardize income tax base (go broad, all economists say, so tax imputed rents like Denmark and Switzerland). 
(Once we have standardized income and payroll taxes do Canada CRA for state tax collection too.) 
More excise tax revenue should be left to states, like in Germany, (unless the federal government is going to 
tackle the problems you are trying to fix with the excise taxes). 
Lottery and gambling revenue should go the level that takes the lead on tackling addiction problems.  
I think I prefer to put gift and inheritance tax revenue into equalization or grant funds because
richer states and regions will have larger inheritances so this will help distribute wealth broadly.
Not like this matters much anyway because this revenue is very small in the US. 
(We could focus more on <a href="https://www.taxjusticenow.com">stopping evasion</a>, 
or lowering threshold or raising the tax rate).
The United States should also centralize its social insurance to better distribute income. Centralize Medicaid, 
unemployment insurance (good for when regional economies have idiosyncratic declines, or a national recession), sick pay, 
do universal child benefits
(because 
<a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/report-measuring-the-child-tax-credits-economic-and-community-impact/">
it gives more money to states and regions with more children</a> 
and children can't work and thus have no taxable income),
put all state and local government employees in Social Security. 
In the longer run, I think enough states will get to a consensus push all health insurance to the national OR state level.
If states run health care (like in Canada), then copy Canada Health Transfer.
Otherwise, use payroll taxes or general revenue to fund the health system.
Basically one of Canada, France, the Netherlands, or Switzerland (don't think anyone or any state is going to do the

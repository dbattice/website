<h1>A Citizen's Guide to Taxation</h1>
<p>
Principles of taxation include tax things with negative externalities first. This is because taxing those things 
should lead to less of those things. It is has the additional feature of letting people consume what they want 
while making them pay more for consuming things with bad consequenes. This is called 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigouvian_taxation">Pigouvian taxation</a>. 
When governments levy excise taxes, the taxes revenue <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/excise-taxes-excise-tax-trends">
should be used to fund the cost you are trying to internailze</a>. (There is an addtional reason, 
which is that excise tax revenue tends to be volatile and should not be relied on for general revenue.)
This is why gasoline tax revenue is generally used to fund infrastructure, 
(see the Highway Trust Fund in the United States),  
and why cigarette taxes are used to fund the health system in some way, at least in  
(<a href="https://healthsystemsfacts.org/france/france-health-system-financing/">France </a> and the  
<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11941">United States</a>.)
The next principle of taxation is to tax a broad base and at a low rate. This means that income taxes, corporate taxes, 
and sales taxes (or consumption taxes generally) should apply to all items at the same rate. Unfortunately, 
many states tend to tax groceries at a lower rate or not at all. The best approach to consumption taxes is 
what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_Services_Tax_(New_Zealand)">
New Zealand does</a> because everything is taxed at 15%. (There is even a joke about when they legalized prostitution,
someone asked if prostitutions services would be subject to the VAT, and they finance minister said, 'Of course.')
New Zealand has among the highest VAT revenues (OECD Tax Stats database code 5100). 
The reason I mentioned New Zealand's VAT here is that it usually preferred to tax consumption instead of income 
or corporations. This is because savings are not taxed (more important in developing countries where they need 
investment to grow richer), and it is much harder to evade taxes. Ultimately if you are taxed on income less, 
evenutally that money will be spent (yes, it is a little fuzzy for large nonprofit funds or generational fortunes) 
and taxed. 
Ramsey proved that you should 
<a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/mankiw/files/optimal_taxation_in_theory.pdf">tax 
inelastic things more</a> because it is more efficient. This is one reason taxing carbon would be good, because 
things that produce carbon are relatively inelastic. 
Diamond and Mirrlees showed that under some assumptions 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Diamond#Diamond%E2%80%93Mirrlees_production_efficiency_result">taxing 
final goods</a> is the optimal way to tax consumption.
There is also a paper on how under oligopolistic businesses, 
<a href="https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/174104/1/E2015_15.pdf">VATs raise more revenue 
than other taxes</a>. 
And Worthwhile Canadian here is suggesting that you should 
<a href="https://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2017/06/150-years-of-federal-consumption-taxation.html">tax 
consumption because it is more pro growth than other forms of taxation</a>.
The main way this would work <a href="https://www.imf.org/~/media/Files/Publications/WP/2019/WPIEA2019096.ashx">is 
probably lower administrative costs</a> (and I suspect lower evasion too, with more on evasion later). 
It is usually preferable to tax capital income less than 
labor income, and labor income less than consumption. 
Correlary: payroll taxes are better than income taxes. 
I think this is especially true for 'welfare state' revenue. In other words, paryoll taxes in 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_Finland#Social_Security_Contributions">Finland</a> 
or <a href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skatt_i_Sverige">Sweden</a> are ideal, 
because they do not have a cap and the revenue goes directly to the funding of pensions, health, unemployment insurance, 
parental benefits, sick pay, and anything else like that 
(minus the general payroll tax in Sweden, although that is a complex topic I don't want to deal with). 
I am also quite confident in saying that DBCFT would be better than 
the current US corporate tax, although it could be quite devestating for smaller and developing countries.
This can get more complicated when taking into account other priorities.
(how progressive should income taxation be? how much should corporations be taxed? 
These I think are more political than economic because of evidence from the OECD having lots of variation.
There are just questions that matter way more than tweaking the corporate tax rate or income tax brackets slightly.) 
</p>
<p>
You might notice that I have not mentioned property taxes yet. This is because I think everyone should move 
to land value taxes (used barely by Estonia Denmark and Taiwan) and massively upzone land (closer to Japan).
and this also means that inputed rents should be taxes. Basically, you shouldn't favor home ownership in tax policy. 
(There are also things like mortgage intereset deduction, SALT deduction, and not taxing gains from houses if you 
immediately buy another house with the funds, just to name a few.) I could right several posts about this, 
but I will stop here for now. 
</p>
<p>
The other thing I want to mention is distributional issues. People are rightly concerned about who pays taxes 
and if some people are not paying their fair share. So consumption taxes do tend to be regressive, but this can be offset 
with generic tax credits. Income taxes can be flat or progressive, and usually have a threshold before you start 
paying income taxes. Corporate taxes have no obvious implications, other than don't make them too high because it seems 
bad for growth and investment. (pretty sure there are papers I can sight here)
Property taxes tax home owners, but there are so many loopholes it is not even really a proper property tax.
A great way to increase property tax revenue would be reduce the loopholes. (Again, I could write a whole post on 
failures of property taxes, but that is for another time.) 
The main thing with corporate, income, and property taxes is to reduce the number of exceptions. 
It tends to be the largest corporations and the richest people who use the exceptions the most, and they 
often lobby to include or keep these exemptions that only a few people benefit from, 
at the cost of higher taxes on everyone else.
</p>
<p>
Tax evasion is the other big thing that citizens should think about. You really want to have broad based 
consumption taxes as a backstop on other forms of evasion. Also, Henrik Kleven has a nice paper saying that 
Denmark can have high taxes because 
<a href="https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/kleven-knudsen-kreiner-pedersen-saezNBER10taxaudit.pdf">evasion 
is low because most taxes are reported by third parties</a>. 
This is mostly true for sales taxes and most employees who are not self employed in the United States, 
but is even more true in Denmark because of how VATs work. (Although the real champ here is the 
<a href="https://prospect.org/world/best-tax-system-on-earth-faroe-islands/"Faroe Islands</a> with honorable mention to 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNxuaOFlbFc"Estonia</a>.)
(Also, the story of the Danish King <a href="https://tontinecoffeehouse.com/2019/06/24/the-sound-toll/">Christian IV 
is a great example of tax enforcement</a>.
One final pendatic, but probably the most political in this entire post, is that optimal revenue will not be perfect enforcement.
What I mean is that tax enforcement costs money, and given that no tax enforcement raises no money and perfect tax enforcement 
would have a very high cost for that last thousand dollars of tax revenue the optimal point on strictly net revenue grounds 
(<i>net revenue=total revenue collected-enforcement costs</i>)
will be below the revenue collected from point of 100% tax compliance. Note I am not talking about all the random deductions 
and credits in the tax code that make it super complex, strictly tax evasion, although the complexity makes it easier to evade
by making it harder to ensure some paid the correct taxes and by making it easier to shuffle things to make it look 
legimate because one could be using the dedcutions and credits legitimately. 
I think this is very bad because it undermines confidence in the fairness 
of taxation, and reduces the willingness to raise taxes necessary to fund public goods and maintain high trust that no one 
is cheating the system. Basically, don't become Italy, become Faroe Islands (with your preferred tax rates as you please). 
</p>
<p>
Now, when here your state or municipality is considering raising taxes, the only thing you should be asking is 
'is the revenue going to be spent on something I like or not?' People will saying dumb things about taxes, 
because they don't like taxes. But some spending is quite popular, like paying teachers more, or funding local libraries. 
(Melinda Cooper wrote a <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/781334">paper on Neoliberalism and the Virginia School</a>, 
where one of the points she makes is 
that people think the government should spend more on various policy areas but don’t like higher taxes. 
And this seems corroborated by  <a href="https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/saez-AEAlecture.pdf">Saez 
finding that tax increases are more likely to pass if tied to particular thing</a>.) 
But even this misses some of the main questions, like is this an efficient way to accomplish the goal? Sometimes there 
is no other way, in the case of funding libraries, for example, you just have to hire people and pay for books to have 
more books in the library. But in the case of a city bus network, you could also consider cutting 
(or reducing the frequency of) the least used routes, 
buying more fuel efficient buses to save money for other purposes. The point is that putting more money into something 
isn't always the most efficient way to accomplish a goal, even if it is the politically favored way. 
(There are a couple of things I don't really want to mention here because I think they are bad policy, 
but you could consider cutting some government employee salaries, 
which I would only do for relatively unskilled jobs that are clearly way overpaid relative to the private sector, 
or getting higher levels of government to fund your thing, which encourages overspending and lack of trying to minimize 
unnecessary costs. This is somewhat politically defined, but Alon Levy has documented many ways in which transit 
is too expensive. One example is that 
<a href="https://pedestrianobservations.com/2016/08/31/amtraks-rolling-stock-order-followup/">
Amtrak paid way too much money for new high speed trains</a>.)
</p>
<p>
To further illustrate this point, I think it is helpful to look at examples. 
Various countries do various things for climate reasons. The straightforward thing to do is tax carbon dioxide 
emissions, but that runs into <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/722970">
many political problems</a>. So, one thing that you can do instead is mandate 
efficiency on appliances or vehicles, require a percentage of electricity come from green sources, or you can do 
backdoor taxes and subsidies. It seems that the best thing for poorer households though is the 
<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w23677">carbon tax</a>. 
However, there was a very interesting paper published by the Norwegian statistics agency saying that 
<a href="https://www.ssb.no/en/natur-og-miljo/forurensning-og-klima/artikler/green-technology-policies-versus-carbon-pricing">
businesses preferred the regulatory approach because it didn't increase taxes</a>. 
More generally, the Niskanen Center published a piece about 
<a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/cost-disease-socialism-how-subsidizing-costs-while-restricting-supply-drives-americas-fiscal-imbalance/">
how regulations can increase costs</a> even though 
the regulations are supposed to decrease costs or increase quality, but these costs are largely paid by government 
agencies, meaning the regulations are increasing expenditure which is covered by more taxes. 
Going back to the private sector, many benefits form working are funded by broad payroll taxes in other countries,
but in the US they are often mandated if they even exist. The obvious example here is health insurance, but 
sick pay also falls in this category. (I do find it hilarious that China is 
<a href="https://fortune.com/2021/08/06/china-big-tech-crackdown-billionaires-philanthropy-giving-donations/">forcing</a>
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-26/billionaire-donations-soar-in-china-push-for-common-prosperity">capitalists</a>
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ywang/2021/08/26/chinas-tech-giants-are-giving-away-their-money-to-avoid-beijings-wrath/">to donate</a>), 
money instead of taxing them.) 
To further illustrate this point, I want to compare taxes and spending in Australia, and the United States.
Most of the big spending categories in rich countries is pensions and health. So in Australia and 
the government collects a bunch of tax revenue and spending it directly on insurance or public 
hospitals, where as in the United States, it is a mix of taxes and mandated spending by businesses. This has nothing 
to do with how much each country spends on health, but if the United States was to spend all of its money via 
the government instead of roughly half and half that would immediately increase government taxes and spending. 
For pensions, Australia writes everyone one over a certain age a check and then mandates business put money into 
something like a 401(k), that workers can withdraw from in retirement. The United Kingdom seems to have a basic 
social security scheme like the United States, but also an occupational pension that people have to opt out of if they want. 
The United States has its Social Security scheme and 401(k)s and other savings schemes. So on paper, Australia spends 
the least on pensions, however, their retirement accounts have a contribution rate higher than the employer portion 
of social security in the United States. Is Australia's pension scheme really cheaper? They are just funding without 
the government directly taxing and spending, but the government is mandating spending, which functions like a tax. 
Matt Bruenig has a great post on how if you look at the health system the same way, the US actually has the second
<a href="https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2019/04/08/us-workers-are-highly-taxed-when-you-count-health-premiums/">highest 
taxes</a> as a percent of compensation. 
(Side note: it seems like in the United States today, there could be a compromise 
where richer people and businesses agree to pay more taxes in exchange for fewer regulations, 
but devil is in the details, I am not sure if businesses would take that deal.)
The arguments we should have about taxation is 
how we fund specific things like transportation (should roads be funded 
with car taxes and fuel taxes, or general revenue?) or sales taxes vs income taxes vs property taxes. 
The other thing is that due to 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol%27s_cost_disease">Baumol's cost disease</a> and 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner%27s_law">Wagner's law</a>, 
taxes tend to go up over time and likely will in the future especially because the government 
funds most of pensions, health care, and education and the population is getting older in almost every country. 
I really wish the people that didn't like taxes would focus more on corruption and private incentives, 
and the win-win oppportunities of lowering of government spending while still achieving goals,
like the aforementioned example of Amtrak overpaying for new trains. 
</p>
<p>
A couple of other odds and ends: laws that limit tax rates are dumb. If you (the public via the government) want to spend 
money on something, you raise the taxes to do so. <b>That is literally it</b>. I am very skeptical of automatic rebates or 
lowering of taxes as well. Referendums on taxes have problems because they can be captured by special interests 
and focus the debate on dumb things. People don't understand finance, so be a little skeptical of claims involving bonds, 
debt, and deficits. Which reminds me that there are times when deficits are required for a good economy, 
but this in recessions and should be done by the federal government (or the national government of your country). 
I saw a joke on how Sweden has had no net increase in debt for about 20 years; what an amazingly irresponsible fiscal policy 
(which was accompanied by negative bond rates for a lot of the post 2008 recession period).

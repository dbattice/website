<h6>Starting notes for urbanism</h6>
<p>M Nolan Gray wrote a fantastic book about zoning called Arbitrary Lines.
In this book, he walks through the history of zoning in the United States and thinks it has utterly failed.
He proposes an alternative, which is the starting point of how to fix zoning below. 
Abolish parking requirements, maximum heights, floor to area ratio, coverage ratio, minimum lot sizes. 
Do transit oriented development around rail stations and frequent bus routes/hubs. 
Reregulate automobiles, increase gasoline taxes and car registration fees and toll roads.
<a href="https://www.mercatus.org/research/policy-briefs/housing-reform-states-menu-options-2024">Many good recommendations 
here</a>.</p>
<p>Good examples include Berlin, Freiburg im Breisgau, Munich, Vienna, Zurich, Basel, Milan, Paris, Strasbourg, Rennes, 
Lund is a university town on a commuter rail line close to Malmö.  
Stockholm transit oriented development challenging geography for metro high commuter rail ridership too biking in not-winter, 
Helsinki has great housing goals good transit, and very walkable. Amsterdam is Amsterdam, 
Utrecht is a university town with trams and the busiest rail station in Netherlands and an intercity rail hub, 
Almere is a recent construction on an island reclaimed from sea, 
Delft is decent size city with trams and trains between Rotterdam and Den Haag, 
Groningen innovative city smallish with lots of students, 
Ghent history on car free center and politics there of.
Dordrecht smaller towns connected to bigger city, near nature, historical
Roosendaal seems to be commuter town with cross border trains
Seville biking metro walkable center outer areas are good too pedestrianized avenida de la constitución, 
Madrid metro is great, Barcelona metro is great improving biking, 
Pontevedra small city car free center people walk a lot, 
Prague eastern europe metro and commuter rail horrible for cars though, Brno has super high tram ridership, 
London innovative on fares, large city with good transit, 
New York City extensive 24 hour metro plus buses and biking very walkable, 
Toronto decent subway improving the GO transit to be an S-Bahn does have density in center but politics screw up the city, 
Auckland upzoning and transit, 
Vancouver very frequent metro can be expanded walkable city, Tokyo is Tokyo, 
Seoul cheap construction very good subway, 
Hong Kong has a private, very profitable metro.</p>
<p>There are no excuses for doing urbanism well. See Oulu, Helsinki, Trondheim, 
Seville, Santiago, Copenhagen, Munich, Tokyo, Lisbon, Amsterdam, 
Pontevedra, Houten, Zermatt, Berlin, and Rome. </p> 
<p>The reason I say this is because people will say that you can only have good cities when the weather if favorable, 
when you have city that is flat enough or not hilly, when a city is rich enough, when it is the right size, 
and this is only for large cities not their suburbs or smaller towns. All of this is wrong. Oulu and Helsinki are 
cold and yet Oulu is pretty good for biking, including complex contracts to clear bike paths quickly when it snows. 
Helsinki isn't quite as cold, isn't quite as good for cycling, but still has lots of walking and transit. 
Trondheim is also a smaller city in northern Norway that has very high ridership for its tram and bus system.
On the other end of the spectrum, Seville Spain is notorious for being one of the hottest cities in Europe. And yet 
it is probably the cycling leader in Spain, has a good bus network, has a commuter rail network, one metro line 
(for now), and is quite walkable. They even turned one of the busiest roads in the middle of the downtown into a 
pedestrian street. They do have adaptions to the heat, like putting up cover over the busiest pedestrian streets 
in the summer. Santiago, Chile similarly is quite hot, but they still have half way decent transit and walkability it seems.
The other key point is that Santiago is not nearly as rich as any city in the United States, Europe, Asia, or Oceania
with good urbanism. Copenhagen is interesting because they became such a good urban center because the city 
was going bankrupt and had to make a ton of changes to get back to solvency, but now is thriving. 
Munich and Tokyo are great examples of how the whole region can function well as a city, with good transit to suburbs, 
(although Munich has integrated fares, but Tokyo still works relatively seemlessly), and Munich is one of the larger cities 
in Germany and Europe and is only a state capital, although it is very rich. Tokyo is one of the largest cities in the 
world, and its population keeps growing despite Japan's shrinking population. Then there are Lisbon and Amsterdam. 
Lisbon is a very hilly city that can be quite difficult to walk through with its steep hills. On the hand, Amsterdam 
and the rest of the Netherlands is very flat, Amsterdam is also quite rainy. Tokyo and the rest of Japan are built 
to withstand earthquakes and tsunamis. And lastly, size doesn't matter. Pontevedra is an amazing 
small city of less than 100000 people. 
They have pedestrianized the core of the city and have a growing population in a region and country with little or 
declining population growth. And Houten is a suburb of Utrecht that is very pleasent to walk and cycle through, along with 
having multiple train stations and the Utrecht tram system having stops in Houten too. And lastly, Zermatt is a skiing town 
in Switzerland, up in the mountains, that is very good at urbanism as well. Zermatt is a town with about 5800 people.
Berlin has the best rail system in Germany, is surprisingly not dense or that rich, but is still the capital 
of Germany. Berlin is walkable too. Although they are going backwards because of dumb political reasons. 
Seville and Rome both have many historical sites and buildings worth preserving yet they can still build metros 
and have a good urban area. 
</p>
<p>Urbanism is important and connected to basically every problem in society.</p>

<h6>Starting notes for Spanish history</h6>
<p>Iberia was settled by many different people, including groups 
the Celts, Aquitanians, Basques, Lusitanians, Tartessians, Gallaecans. Ibera was partly conquered by the Carthaginians. 
Rome then destroyed Carthage and took control of its empire. Along the way, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numantine_War">Tiberius Gracchus negotiated a treaty
with the Numantians</a> (now in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numantia">province of Soria</a>, 
Castille and Leon). Tiberius Gracchus was deemed to have done badly with this treaty, 
even though he saved Romans from being slaughtered. This was one of the earliest events in his life that he is known for,
and Tiberius Gracchus was 
<a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/mike-duncan/the-storm-before-the-storm/9781478999645/?lens=publicaffairs">one 
of the key figures in the story of how Rome ended up weak enough to become an empire</a>, with Julius Caesar being the first
emperor. (The Numantians still live on in Spain, for example the name of the soccer club 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD_Numancia">CD Numancia</a>.)
Rome collapsed (slowly) and then the Goths took over the Iberian Peninsula. 
(One famous remnant of the Visigoths today in Spain is the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque%E2%80%93Cathedral_of_C%C3%B3rdoba">Mosque-Cathedral 
of Córdoba</a> (Mezquita-catedral de Córdoba).
The Visigoths built a church in the city of Córdoba, and then later, Muslims built a mosque over it.)
In the 700s the Muslims conqured almost all of Iberia (minus Asturias), 
would have continued but were beaten by Charles Martel in the Battle of Tours. The Reconquista started shortly after the 
conquest of Iberia, only ending in 1492, when Fernando and Isabel finally conquered Granada (and eventually 
were buried there), got married, and sponsored Christopher Columbus's voyage to America. 
The marriage was definitely political, as it secrued Isabel on the throne of Castilla. Also, they are called 
the <i>Reyes Catolicos</i>, or Catholic Monarchs, but Isabel was absolutely pious, and Fernando was Catholic 
as a convenience, for political reasons more than true piety. 
They had a daughter Juana la Loca who married Felipe el Hermoso, son of the Holy Roman Emperor,
and they had a son Charles V. Isabel died in 1504, at which point, Juana la Loca nominally ruled but was 
sequestered in a castle in Tordesillas while Fernando maintained the Castillian kingdom. Meanwhile, 
Fernando wanted a son, and married a French noblewomen, Germaine de Foix. The attempt to have a son failed, 
but the throne of part of Navarra was tied Fernando and his heirs, and the other part became part of the French Kingdom. 
When Felipe el Hermoso died a couple months after Fernando II, Juana ruled jointly with her son Charles V,
although Charles continued to policy of keeping his mother locked away in Tordesillas.
became the king of almost everywhere except most of modern France and the British Isles. 
Charles inherited the Spanish territories in the Americas, and in the Pacific,
not to mention most of the Iberian Peninsula, and had family connection to Portugal (which included
Brazil and places like Taiwain and Macau) many islands in the Mediterranean, and southern Italy. 
And since Felipe el Hermoso was the son of Maxilimilian I and Mary of Burgundy, 
Charles V inheriteded a chunk on land in what is now Eastern France. Burgunday was also possible the richest place in 
Europe at the time, such that his mother was often called 'the Rich'. He also conquered the Duchy of Milan.
Once his grandfather Maximilian I died, the Holy Roman Empire was up for grabs. At the time, the position was 
chosen by seven electors, who were noblemen with other titles and lands. And by chosen, I mean bribed. Charles did 
indeed pay off the electors, using money borrowed by the Castillian kingdom, which put him in massive debt. (This was 
part of the process that lead to European finance, and in this case Charles borrowed money from Jakob Fugger 
to finance the Imperial throne.) It should be noted that the Holy Roman Emperor didn't actually have that much power, 
but he had a huge base of allies he could call on and get some money from to finance whatever he needed to. 
Charles had a son Felipe II,
who moved the capital of Spain from Toledo to Madrid because it was more central. Felipe inherited everything except 
the Holy Roman Empire, which went to his uncle Ferdinand II. In the 1600s, Felipe's descendents were getting so much 
money from the gold and silver from the Americas, which went up the Guadalquivier through Cadiz and Seville. 
Spain also had the best soldiers in the 1500s through middle of 1600s, the tercios. Spain was one of the princple 
nations involved in the Thirty Years War, and towards the end lost military dominance, lost money from Americas, 
lost land to France and others, Conde-Duque de Olivares was corrupt and bad, Catalonia and Portugal revolted,
and Spanish elites prioritized keep Catalonia because they didn't want France and Catalonia allying, 
and thus lost Portugal forever. Also treaties with France and Pigeon Island. 
At the start of the 1700s, Carlos II didn't have an heir because of inbreeding,
which triggered a war of succcession. This is when Spain became united as Spain due to the Nueva Planta decrees.
This meant Spanish, French, and Italian monarchs couldn't have more than one of those thrones. This matters later. 
Brief Spanish republic, followed by the restoration and Alfonso XII and his son, Alfonso XIII. Also start of industrialization. 
Also the Basque Fueros, and centralization of Spain. In the 1800s there was the liberal revolutions and Isabel II. 
WWI followed by republicanism and dictatorships and turbulent political times, abdication of Alfonso XIII, Miguel 
Primo de Rivera and successors, fighting in Morocco, Civil Wars and Franco Dictatorship. Restoration of (weak) monrachy,
Juan Carlos I and Adolfo Suarez and transition to democracy. Booming economy, becoming a typical western european country. 
2008 crash and then catalan unrest, and Covid, through 2023 elections.

<h6>electrification and electricity systems compared</h6>
Alternating current is used for electric grids. Three phase is also used for electric grids.
To start, higher voltages require less current to transfer energy. 
Higher voltages mean lower currents and smaller wires. Smaller wires mean less losses to the electric motors. 
DC voltage is more efficient but transmission is more expensive (related to why most metros are DC voltage). 
DC voltage is better for longer distances too. 
Electric frequency. Electricity mains. Why france, Japan, Brazil are weird. 
Standards of electricity. 
Transmission and transformers. 
However, higher voltages are more dangerous, and more likely to arc, even if the total risk of arcing is small. 
Electricity mains most are 110 volts plus or minus 10% or 230 plus or minus 10%. 
Basically everyone is 50 or 60 hertz. Japan is split into two different systems. 
Lots of copying neighbors or using colonizers' standards. Look at standardization history and first countries to electrify. 

<h6>Trains </h6>
<p>Electric trains are driven by electric motors, and run over wires. This is obvious but has some physics and engineering 
implications for how electric trains work. 
<a href="https://www.ctc-n.org/technologies/regenerative-braking-trains">AC is easier to do regenerative braking</a>, 
even though DC voltage can do it too. 
Types of electric motors. AC vs DC motors.
Catenary vs third rail vs others.
The important things about electric motors are the frequency, the voltage, 
and the input power. DC motors use rectifiers (which are basically diodes) to only allow the current to flow one way, 
into the motor.
AC motors will use the frequecy directly and on trains this usally aligns to the country's main electricity source frequency
(50 or 60 hertz) 
while having AC voltage of 15 or 25 kilovolts. The main exceptions here are Germany, Sweden, Norway, Austria, and Switzerland
(16.7 Hz, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_kV_AC_railway_electrification">which used to be 16 and 2/3, 
which was exactly 1/3 of electricity frequency of 50 hertz</a>).
</p>
<p>So I was looking at train electrication and WTF Acela? Why do you have three different electrified systems,
including different frequencies and 12 and 12.5 kilovolts on different parts? 
This led me down a rabbit hole looking at the history of the Northeast Corridor. 
So the NEC was really merged into Amtrak and all the constituent lines were built by different companies 
at different times with different technologies and they sometimes copied nearby examples, 
like the Pennsylvania railroad which copied the New York New Haven and Hartford Railroad lines with 11 kV AC 25 Hz. 
This electrification was deemed good enough in the early 1900s because we weren’t as good at electrification 
technology and struggled to make electrification work over longer distances, even though today it is much easier 
and cheaper and more efficient. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amtrak%27s_25_Hz_traction_power_system">This 
is why basically from New York City to DC and also SEPTA and 
also parts of lines in Connecticut use 25 Hz</a>, even though the rest of the NEC is 60 Hz.
In fact, there was a Connecticut supreme court decision banning third rail because it was too dangerous. 
This led to some experimentation by the New York New Haven and Hartford Line, where they 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification_of_the_New_York,_New_Haven,_and_Hartford_Railroad">settled on 
11 kilovolts AC as the optimal electrification system</a>, (AC being chosen because of the longer distances 
and third rail DC not an option). 25 Hz was chosen because there were several other lines already using 25 Hz, 
even though they thought that 15 Hz was better if you could start from scratch, due to lower losses. 
In the 1970s there was a plan to move the 25 Hz system to 60 Hz, but was deemed to expensive. 
Instead the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amtrak%27s_25_Hz_traction_power_system">voltage 
was increased from 11 kV to 12 kV</a>.
Also, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Jersey_Coast_Line">part of the NEC in New Jersey 
was originally the 11 kV AC 25 Hz</a>, but was moved to 12 kV 25 Hz AC in the 1970s, and now is 25 kV 60 Hz AC.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification_of_the_New_York,_New_Haven_and_Hartford_Railroad">Metro North</a>, 
which shares some of the NEC track, was converted from the 11 kV AC 25 Hz to 12 kV 25 Hz AC, 
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Haven_Line">then upgraded to 12.5 kV AC 60 Hz in the late 1980s 
when a power station got shut down for some reason</a>?
In the early 1990s, Congress passed a law to 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amtrak%27s_60_Hz_traction_power_system">convert Boston to New York</a> on the NEC 
to 25 kV AC 60 Hz. This was done to improve Amtrak solvency and reduce trip times. 
So that is a basic outline of why, which then leads to the question of why not standardize to 25 kV AC instead of 
12.5 kV AC or go even further and make the whole NEC 25 kV AC? The most obvious answer is that rewiring 
the hundreds of miles of 12kV 25 Hz would be very expensive for minimal gain, even though it would make 
people like me happy to see one unified electrification system. Also, there really isn't anything wrong 
with the current system other than new trains require slightly higher costs to be able to run on all three 
electrification systems. Also, 
<a href="https://railroad.net/25-kv-60-hz-ac-on-the-entire-northeast-corridor-t171590.html">increasing the voltage 
would require more clearance between the overhead wires and the train</a>, 
which would require a lot of work to make that extra room where ever that situation occurs. 
I still think it would be worth exploring making the 12.5 kV AC match the 25 kV AC like the rest of the NEC 
north of New York City, but that requires coordination with Metro-North and would probably have to be funded by Amtrak 
or the federal government to get them to agree. I would like to see a cost estimate of this though.

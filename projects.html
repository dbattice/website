<h6>Starting notes for urbanism</h6>
<p>M Nolan Gray wrote a fantastic book about zoning called Arbitrary Lines.
In this book, he walks through the history of zoning in the United States and thinks it has utterly failed.
He proposes an alternative, which is the starting point of how to fix zoning below. 
Abolish parking requirements, maximum heights, floor to area ratio, coverage ratio, minimum lot sizes. 
Do transit oriented development around rail stations and frequent bus routes/hubs. 
Reregulate automobiles, increase gasoline taxes and car registration fees and toll roads.</p>
<p>Good examples include Berlin, Freiburg im Breisgau, Munich, Vienna, Zurich, Basel, Milan, Paris, Strasbourg, Rennes, 
Lund is a university town on a commuter rail line close to Malmö.  
Stockholm transit oriented development challenging geography for metro high commuter rail ridership too biking in not-winter, 
Helsinki has great housing goals good transit, and very walkable. Amsterdam is Amsterdam, 
Utrecht is a university town with trams and the busiest rail station in Netherlands and an intercity rail hub, 
Almere is a recent construction on an island reclaimed from sea, 
Delft decent size city with trams and trains between Rotterdam and Den Haag, 
Groningen innovative city smallish with lots of students, 
Ghent history on car free center and politics there of.
Dordrecht smaller towns connected to bigger city, near nature, historical
Roosendaal seems to be commuter town with cross border trains
Seville biking metro walkable center outer areas are good too pedestrianized avenida de la constitución, 
Madrid metro is great, Barcelona metro is great improving biking, 
Pontevedra small city car free center people walk a lot, 
Prague eastern europe metro and commuter rail horrible for cars though, Brno has super high tram ridership, 
London innovative on fares, large city with good transit, 
New York City extensive 24 hour metro plus buses and biking very walkable, 
Toronto decent subway improving the GO transit to be an S-Bahn does have density in center but politics screw up the city, 
Auckland upzoning and transit, 
Vancouver very frequent metro can be expanded walkable city, Tokyo is Tokyo, 
Seoul cheap construction very good subway, 
Hong Kong has a private, very profitable metro.</p>
<p>There are no excuses for doing urbanism well. See Oulu, Helsinki, Seville, Santiago, Munich, Tokyo, Lisbon, Amsterdam, 
Pontevedra, Houten, and Zermatt.</p> 
<p>The reason I say this is because people will say that you can only have good cities when the weather if favorable, 
when you have city that is flat enough or not hilly, when a city is rich enough, when it is the right size, 
and this is only for large cities not their suburbs or smaller towns. All of this is wrong. Oulu and Helsinki are 
cold and yet Oulu is pretty good for biking, including complex contracts to clear bike paths quickly when it snows. 
Helsinki isn't quite as cold, isn't quite as good for cycling, but still has lots of walking and transit. 
On the other end of the spectrum, Seville Spain is notorious for being one of the hottest cities in Europe. And yet 
it is probably the cycling leader in Spain, has a good bus network, has a commuter rail network, one metro line 
(for now), and is quite walkable. They even turned one of the busiest roads in the middle of the downtown into a 
pedestrian street. They do have adaptions to the heat, like putting up cover over the busiest pedestrian streets 
in the summer. Santiago, Chile similarly is quite hot, but they still have half way decent transit and walkability it seems. 
Munich and Tokyo are great examples of how the whole region can function well as a city, with good transit to suburbs, 
(although Munich has integrated fares, but Tokyo still works relatively seemlessly), and Munich is one of the larger cities 
in Germany and Europe and is only a state capital, although it is very rich. Tokyo is one of the largest cities in the 
world, and its population keeps growing despite Japan's shrinking population. Then there are Lisbon and Amsterdam. 
Lisbon is a very hilly city that can be quite difficult to walk through with its steep hills. On the hand, Amsterdam 
and the rest of the Netherlands is very flat, Amsterdam is also quite rainy. Tokyo and the rest of Japan are built 
to withstand earthquakes and tsunamis. And lastly, size doesn't matter. Pontevedra is an amazing 
small city of less than 100000 people. 
They have pedestrianized the core of the city and have a growing population in a region and country with little or 
declining population growth. And Houten is a suburb of Utrecht that is very pleasent to walk and cycle through, along with 
having multiple train stations and the Utrecht tram system having stops in Houten too. And lastly, Zermatt is a skiing town 
in Switzerland, up in the mountains, that is very good at urbanism as well. Zermatt is a town with about 5800 people. 
<p>Urbanism is important and connected to basically every problem in society.</p>

<h6>Starting notes for Spanish history</h6>
<p>Iberia was conquered by the Romans (Tiberius Gracchus treaty), Rome collapsed was the Goths took over 
(building of the Mesquita de Cordoba). In the 700s the Muslims conqured almost all of Iberia (minus Asturias), 
would have continued but were beaten by Charles Martel in the Battle of Tours. Reconquista started shortly after, 
only ending in 1492, when Fernando and Isabel finally conquered Granada (and are buried there), got married, 
and sponsered Christopher Columbus's voyage to America. They had a daughter Juana la Loca married Felipe el Hermoso
and they had a son Charles V. Felipe died a couple months after Fernando II, and Charles V became 
became the king of almost everywhere except most of modern France and the British Isles. Charles V had a son Felipe II,
who moved the capital of Spain from Toledo to Madrid because it was more central. Felipe inherited everything except 
the Holy Roman Empire, which went to his uncle Ferdinand II. In the 1600s, Felipe's descendents were getting so much 
money from the gold and silver from the Americas, which went up the Guadalquivier through Cadiz and Seville. 
Spain also had the best soldiers in the 1500s through middle of 1600s, the tercios. Spain was one of the princple 
nations involved in the Thirty Years War, and towards the end lost military dominance, lost money from Americas, 
lost land to France and others, Conde-Duque de Olivares was corrupt and bad, Catalonia and Portugal revolted,
and Spanish elites prioritized keep Catalonia because they didn't want France and Catalonia allying, 
and thus lost Portugal forever. Also treaties with France and Pigeon Island. 
At the start of the 1700s, Carlos II didn't have an heir because of inbreeding,
which triggered a war of succcession. This is when Spain became united as Spain due to the Nueva Planta decrees.
This meant Spanish, French, and Italian monarchs couldn't have more than one of those thrones. This matters later. 
Also the Basque Fueros, and centralization of Spain. In the 1800s there was the liberal revolutions and Isabel II. 
Brief Spanish republic, followed by the restoration and Alfonso XII and his son, Alfonso XIII. Also start of industrialization. 
WWI followed by republicanism and dictatorships and turbulent political times, abdication of Alfonso XIII, Miguel 
Primo de Rivera and successors, fighting in Morocco, Civil Wars and Franco Dictatorship. Restoration of (weak) monrachy,
Juan Carlos I and Adolfo Suarez and transition to democracy. Booming economy, becoming a typical western european country. 
2008 crash and then catalan unrest, and Covid, through 2023 elections. 
</p>

<h6>Starting notes for airports and air travel and air cargo transport</h6>

air traffic control being very precise and strict (polar coordinates). Airports airlines credit card rewards, 
cgpgrey runway numbers, fly standby airport security, airport stores and dutyfree billionaire, 
lowcost airlines, jet fuel delta in 2008 recession and georgia legislature. Biggest and smallest airports. 
Boeing Airbus tariff wars (also Bombardier planes, and Embraer). Airline Alliances. Jetlag? Climate change and flying.
Cargo airports like Memphis. </p>

<h6>Trains </li>
<p> Train electrification and wtf Acela? Asia, Europe, Germanic countries. UK. Standardization. 
Equations of power and voltage. AC vs DC. Rail gauge. Frequency. 
El Tren Maya. Swiss German and Dutch Takt. German elctrical frequency.  
France is bad at timing connections. Germany is unreliable and slower than you think.
Construction costs are cheap in Korea and Italy and Spain, and still low in Sweden. 
Freight rail compared. 
Regulations for passenger and freight. US rail strikes in 2022 and 2023. 
</p>

<h6>Farming, energy, geography, and civilization </h6>
<p>Baku Turkey Cyprus Greece Ukraine Algeria natural gas fracking energy. 
Solar, Flooding climate implications. Agriculture fertilizer energy.
Ian Morris on energy farming and values War measure of civilization, 
geography is destiny, EU energy costs? Energy crisis and oil glut from Helen Thompson. 
Lewis Dartnell on geography influencing history, restarting civilization, 
energy is hard to rebuild from scratch.</p>
<a href="https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/why-is-new-york-so-big">New York City</a> is 
such an important city because it was the best place to get from the Atlantic to the Midwest.

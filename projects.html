<h6>Starting notes for urbanism</h6>
<p>Abolish parking requirements, maximum heights, FAR, coverage ratio, minimum lot sizes. Do transit oriented development 
around rail stations and frequent bus routes/hubs. Reregulate automobiles, increase gasoline taxes and 
car registration fees and toll roads.</p>
<p>Good examples include Berlin, Freiburg im Breisgau, Munich, Vienna, Zurich, Milan, Paris, Strasbourg, Rennes, 
Lund, Stockholm, Helsinki, 
Amsterdam, Utrecht, Almere, Delft, Groningen, Ghent, 
Seville, Madrid, Barcelona, Pontevedra, Prague, Brno, London, 
Toronto, Auckland, Vancouver, Tokyo, Seoul, Hong Kong.</p>
<p>There are no excuses for doing urbanism well. See Oulu, Helsinki, Seville, Santiago, Munich, Tokyo, Amsterdam, 
Houten, and Pontevedra.</p>
<p>Urbanism is important and connected to basically every problem in society.</p>

here</a>. 
<h6>Starting notes for Spanish history</h6>
<p>Iberia was conquered by the Romans (Tiberius Gracchus treaty), Rome collapsed was the Goths took over 
(building of the Mesquita de Cordoba). In the 700s the Muslims conqured almost all of Iberia (minus Asturias), 
would have continued but were beaten by Charles Martel in the Battle of Tours. Reconquista started shortly after, 
only ending in 1492, when Fernando and Isabel finally conquered Granada (and are buried there), got married, 
and sponsered Christopher Columbus's voyage to America. They had a daughter Juana la Loca married Felipe el Hermoso
and they had a son Charles V. Felipe died a couple months after Fernando II, and Charles V became 
became the king of almost everywhere except most of modern France and the British Isles. Charles V had a son Felipe II,
who moved the capital of Spain from Toledo to Madrid because it was more central. Felipe inherited everything except 
the Holy Roman Empire, which went to his uncle Ferdinand II. In the 1600s, Felipe's descendents were getting so much 
money from the gold and silver from the Americas, which went up the Guadalquivier through Cadiz and Seville. 
Spain also had the best soldiers in the 1500s through middle of 1600s, the tercios. Spain was one of the princple 
nations involved in the Thirty Years War, and towards the end lost military dominance, lost money from Americas, 
lost land to France and others, Conde-Duque de Olivares was corrupt and bad, Catalonia and Portugal revolted,
and Spanish elites prioritized keep Catalonia because they didn't want France and Catalonia allying, 
and thus lost Portugal forever. Also treaties with France and Pigeon Island. 
At the start of the 1700s, Carlos II didn't have an heir because of inbreeding,
which triggered a war of succcession. This is when Spain became united as Spain due to the Nueva Planta decrees.
This meant Spanish, French, and Italian monarchs couldn't have more than one of those thrones. This matters later. 
Also the Basque Fueros, and centralization of Spain. In the 1800s there was the liberal revolutions and Isabel II. 
Brief Spanish republic, followed by the restoration and Alfonso XII and his son, Alfonso XIII. Also start of industrialization. 
WWI followed by republicanism and dictatorships and turbulent political times, abdication of Alfonso XIII, Miguel 
Primo de Rivera and successors, fighting in Morocco, Civil Wars and Franco Dictatorship. Restoration of (weak) monrachy,
Juan Carlos I and Adolfo Suarez and transition to democracy. Booming economy, becoming a typical western european country. 
2008 crash and then catalan unrest, and Covid, through 2023 elections.

</p>

<h6>Farming, energy, geography, and civilization </h6>
<p>Baku Turkey Cyprus Greece Ukraine Algeria natural gas fracking energy. 
Solar, Flooding climate implications. Agriculture fertilizer energy.
Ian Morris on energy farming and values War measure of civilization, 
geography is destiny, EU energy costs? Energy crisis and oil glut from Helen Thompson. 
Lewis Dartnell on geography influencing history, restarting civilization, 
energy is hard to rebuild from scratch.</p>
<a href="https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/why-is-new-york-so-big">New York City</a> is 
such an important city because it was the best place to get from the Atlantic to the Midwest.

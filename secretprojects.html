This page is secret because I don't necessarily want my name associated with the politics adjacent views.
This page will be a collection of the secret links. I will try to be as fair to opposing views as possible and 
fully explain as much as possible. Might have a broader look at constitutions and governance later.

a great case for immigration. The quote that sticks out is that restricting immigration wouldn't solve any 
problems, but expanding immigration could help solve problems.</p> 

<h6>Notes on surveys, cognitive biases, and politics</h6>
<p>
Why I don’t like surveys, inflation expectations, Michigan Survey and partisanship, 
<a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2016/august/consumer-surveys-inflation-expectations-fomc">Fed 
research</a> finding that people drastically overestimate inflation, going back decades; 
<a href="https://wentingsong.com/files/macaulay_song_2022.pdf">
paper from Bank of Canada by Song and MacCauley about how twitter drives some of people’s pessimism about the economy</a>. 
<a href="https://twitter.com/AlistairMacaul7/status/1542985646507233280">Twitter thread about this</a>. 
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4266459">
I cannot believe people misunderstand supply restrictions on housing this badly</a>. 
<a href="https://twitter.com/CSElmendorf/status/1588179642841960449">They really are dumb unfortunately</a>. 
Also crime, which people keep thinking is high and rising and wasn't true from early 1990s until 2020. 
Joseph Ucinsky and Michael Schermer on conspiracies. 
Conspiracies happen when you feel powerless. Internet made it easy to connect with other conspiracists. 
Conspiracies are constant but manifest differently over time. 
French believe moon landings were fake. 
Out of power party gets more conspiratorial about party in power. 
Conspiracy theories are kind of a comfort when you don’t have control. 
Collective suffering lessens psychological problems, like Londoners getting bombed in WWII. Also COVID? 
Pluralistic ignorance, 
<a href="https://psyarxiv.com/cr23g/">people hate opposite partisans for views they don’t really hold</a>, 
<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/abs/do-political-elites-have-accurate-perceptions-of-social-conditions/06DFAD98A8E9D9B7A4685BD0D9A53028">politicians 
don't really know how rich or poor their constiutents are but it probably wouldn't change much even if they did</a>, 
people wildly misperceive demographics of the other party, 
people underestimate inequality, etc. 
People with similar beliefs become more extreme when they are around people who are similar to them. 
This reminds me of positive feedback in a closed system, in which a closed system with only positive feedback is 
inherently unstable and will have larger and larger oscillations. 
It seems bad to have a political system with highly clustered ideologies and single member districts, 
but I guess that leads to wanting multimember districts, 
proportional representation, and multiple parties.</p>

<h6>Coronavirus and lessons from other countries </h6> 
<p> Conservatives citing Sweden for optimal corona policy in 2020 drove me crazy. Not only because, 
IF ONLY, but also there is lots to like about Sweden like tax policy, free college, decentralization of 
the welfare state, pensions, strong local communities, more immigrants than US. Switzerland also has 
a lot to learn from sicne Switzerland is also very decentralized and federal, but their welfare sate is much better than US. 
More generally we could learn from Costa Rica about how to not have an army and invest in health and education 
and they promote ecotourism in a lot of ways. Spain also can teach us stuff about decentralization, 
parliamentarism is good, younger generations tend to rebel and so you can learn to how to adapt to that, 
monetary policy is very important. 
Australia shows how you can have a dominant two party system, with state federal cooperation, and parliamentarism. 
Their voting system with AV and their senate work much better than America but not ideal, but to be clear, 
I would take their system in a heartbeat. Mandatory voting is good, and their health system is great, 
probably the best philosophically and practically for American to copy.
Why are Americans so unwilling to ponder what other countries do differently?
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/notjustbikes/comments/111fxjb/poll_results_what_foreign_ways_of_doing_things/">This 
reddit thread is amazing</a> and show Americans want walkable places, VATs, minimum mandatory vacation, 
no tipping, no drug advertising on TV, better more modern banking tech, plausibly quick boiling electric kettles, 
drinking alcohol in public places as long as you are responsible, prefilled tax returns, bidets.

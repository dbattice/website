<h6>
Why Canada should annex the United States
</h6>
<p>
<a href="https://blog.supplysideliberal.com/post/60999482427/quartz-28-benjamin-franklins-strategy-to-make">More 
people make you stronger geopolitically</a>. America is a geopolitical heavyweight due to its large population 
and high incomes. Growing our population would give us more clout. Integrating more countries together 
would further science and development. Additionally this is an excuse to talk about devolution and 
parliamentarism. Canada has parliamentarism and 
<a href="https://twitter.com/hamandcheese/status/1534384380222836736">decentralization of immigration, welfare, 
education, and health</a>. 
Provincial government is better than state government because of parliamentarism and unicameralism, 
plus independent redistricting commissions. <a href="https://twitter.com/hamandcheese/status/1541963320495931392">Taxation 
is about fifty fifty between the federal and provincial governments, minus social security</a>. 
(See Switzerland for how to do social security in a highly decentralized country.) 
Courts are not as important. Canada has lots of hydro power. The US can build fracking in Canada 
mitigating problems with Russian gas, climate change, and related issues. Canada gives media regulation 
to provinces (radio especially). I increasingly think that Canada should annex the states one by one and 
the territories too. I first saw this as a joke about how the US should annex Canada, but I think the reverse 
should happen. The only criticism I have is that the municipal government isn’t the best, but still 
probably better because it is more centralized in the largest municipality in a metro area. 
</p>
<p>
Maximum Canada by Doug Saunders is a similar idea and <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/maximum-canada-is-happening">
Noah Smith thinks it is happening</a>. He also points out that Canada should probably do this so they can 
resist crazy America if it comes to that.
Misha Saul also <a href="https://kvetch.substack.com/p/a-new-hong-kong-in-australia">proposed to let Hong Kongers 
make their own city in Australia</a>.
</p>
<p>In addtion to this annexation, the combined country should consider annexing (at mutual agreement) a slew of 
other territories that have in the past wanted to be part of Canada or the United States. 
The one that is most controversial is Taiwan. This would immediately stop Chinese flaunting of its military near Taiwan, 
immediately help the US position on semiconductors and technology. It would give more Americans a back door to better 
urbanism, or at least examples of such. This could backfire as China gets even more paranoid and aggressive. 
But if we make it clear we are not aggressive, they have no leg to stand on. These options also apply to 
Hong Kong and Macau and Singapore, but for different economic reasons, and not as strategic geopolitically. 
These countries all have something else to contribute institutionally and culturally, while expanding geopolitical weight 
of Mega Canada.
Canada has previously talked about letting in Turks and Caicos, St.Pierre and Miquelon, Bermuda, Bahamas, and Barbados. 
Iceland has also previously discussed joining Canada. These would be fine additions with lots of raw materials, tourism, 
and more water based geopolitical power. 
The United States has discussed adding Greenland, the Mexican states of Yucatán, Quintana Roo, and Campeche 
(which is basically the Yucután peninsula), the Azores (now part of Portugal but an important point during the Cold War), 
Canary Islands (same), Baja California, and Baja California Sur (so close to California already).
</p>
<p>This would bring Mega-America to about 370 million people. Collectively we would all get richer as the 
increased trade and migration would make the poor places better off, and give Mega-America a larger pool 
of skilled people.</p>
<p>Look, I know there are challenges too, like what citizenship laws would be, how do we redistribute to the currently 
poorer places, how do we harmonize laws, how do we handle federalism, subnational taxation, and retirement programs, 
What languages do we use and how? I actually see this happening a lot like the European Union has evolved, 
where there was common guidelines and rules at the start, and then the EU has expanded to cover more and more 
things, and standardized rules and practices among all members. So in Mega-America, we could start by having a basic 
constitution, with some frameworks for income taxes, and free trade, and strong federalism, but over time 
we would have common labor laws, common agricultural laws and subsidies, phasing in of a common currency, 
and slowly harmonize citizenship laws. We might even have to put a damper on migration for a few years like 
David Cameron proposed for the EU, but that cuts against a unified national identity, so I don't know.</p>
<p>This is extremely unlikely to happen between any of these countries, but it is interesting to think about.</p> 

<h6>current thoughts on health care policy</h6>
<p>This is mainly about reforming the health care system in the United States,probably want to copy Australia, Japan, 
or France. I would settle for Switzerland or Germany. (See Professor Busse on Germany.) 
I do think Beveridge is the best philosophically, mainly because 
the incentives of people and the government are high quality or effectiveness at low costs overall.<p>
<p>I think we should approach it as a mix of housing and public school. That is to say everyone pays into public school, 
but people can choose to opt out of public school. Also, we have housing that can be run privately, but also 
public subsized and in cases of low income, outright almost free. So what I envision is basically enrolling everyone 
in Medicare, getting rid of Medicare advantage, making medicaid a sliding scale for those with low incomes. 
Then throw in Finkelstein and Einav's idea of covering "essentials" and public health for everyone. I do like 
Australia because all legal immigrants get the basic coverage and can buy supplemental coverage, and it is 
funded by progressive income taxes. Also, 
Australia has cheap drugs. Japan focuses spending in a way that incentivizes cheaper treatments, by paying 
a fixed amount per treatment based on condition. And France is nice because it is more generous the sicker you are.</p>
For funding this expansion, we could do general revenue and increase income tax rates. We could also 
increase current medicare taxes. I think I would prefer a third thing, which is to do 
split payroll taxes, like Germany and Luxembourg, and then over time switch more to a VAT and/or 
(progressive) income taxes. Set the threshhold at at least current SS cap, with a faster increase in the cap 
than in current SS cap grows. Like, say, inflation/max(median,avg) wage growth plus 5%. 
<p>Also amazing, that in Denmark, there is no link between losing your job and worse health, so get to that. 
And Denmark has very few people opting for private health insurance, which is a good goal to shoot for too.</p>

<h6>Surveys, cognitive biases, and politics</h6>
<p>
Why I don’t like surveys, inflation expectations, Michigan Survey and partisanship, 
<a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2016/august/consumer-surveys-inflation-expectations-fomc">Fed 
research</a> finding that people drastically overestimate inflation, going back decades; 
<a href="https://wentingsong.com/files/macaulay_song_2022.pdf">
paper from Bank of Canada by Song and MacCauley about how twitter drives some of people’s pessimism about the economy</a>. 
<a href="https://twitter.com/AlistairMacaul7/status/1542985646507233280">Twitter thread about this</a>. 
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4266459">
I cannot believe people misunderstand supply restrictions on housing this badly</a>. 
<a href="https://twitter.com/CSElmendorf/status/1588179642841960449">They really are dumb unfortunately</a>. 
In late 2023, people think the economy is bad, but as 
<a href="https://twitter.com/StephanieKelton/status/1732549076682445090">Stephanie 
Kelton points out</a>, they view it worse than the depths fo the 2008 recession. 
Relatedly, people are pessimistic about Joe Biden, 
<a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/we-need-to-see-more-joe-biden">when all the people around 
Trump have much more negative things to say, and some of them have nothing to say about Joe Biden</a>.
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@paulkrugman7/post/C2FenDZOvx3">Paul Krugman also points out that Republicans are 
worse at this in 2023 and that most people say they are doing fine</a>. (Republican point isn't suprising to me). 
Also crime, which people keep thinking is high and rising and wasn't true from early 1990s until 2020. 
<a href="https://asteriskmag.com/issues/04/the-art-of-asking-questions">Adam Mastroianna</a> describing all 
the problems with self-reporting, noting how incomplete it is, but all the other methods are too. This is psychology 
focused but no reason it wouldn't apply to other disciplines.  
Joseph Ucinsky and Michael Schermer on conspiracies. 
Conspiracies happen when you feel powerless. Internet made it easy to connect with other conspiracists. 
Conspiracies are constant but manifest differently over time. 
French believe moon landings were fake. 
Out of power party gets more conspiratorial about party in power. 
Conspiracy theories are kind of a comfort when you don’t have control. 
Collective suffering lessens psychological problems, like Londoners getting bombed in WWII. Also COVID? 
Pluralistic ignorance, 
<a href="https://psyarxiv.com/cr23g/">people hate opposite partisans for views they don’t really hold</a>, 
<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/abs/do-political-elites-have-accurate-perceptions-of-social-conditions/06DFAD98A8E9D9B7A4685BD0D9A53028">politicians 
don't really know how rich or poor their constiutents are but it probably wouldn't change much even if they did</a>, 
people wildly misperceive demographics of the other party, 
people underestimate inequality, etc. 
People with similar beliefs become more extreme when they are around people who are similar to them. 
This reminds me of positive feedback in a closed system, in which a closed system with only positive feedback is 
inherently unstable and will have larger and larger oscillations. 
It seems bad to have a political system with highly clustered ideologies and single member districts, 
but I guess that leads to wanting multimember districts, 
proportional representation, and multiple parties.</p>

<h6>Coronavirus and lessons from other countries </h6> 
<p> Conservatives citing Sweden for optimal corona policy in 2020 drove me crazy. Not only because, 
IF ONLY, but also there is lots to like about Sweden like tax policy, free college, decentralization of 
the welfare state, pensions, strong local communities, more immigrants than US. Switzerland also has 
a lot that the US can learn from, since Switzerland is also very decentralized and federal, but their welfare state 
is much better than US, though worse than the Nordics. 
More generally we could learn from Costa Rica about how to not have an army and invest in health and education 
and they promote ecotourism in a lot of ways. Spain also can teach us stuff about decentralization, 
parliamentarism is good, younger generations tend to rebel and so you can learn to how to adapt to that, 
monetary policy is very important. 
Australia shows how you can have a dominant two party system, with state federal cooperation, and parliamentarism. 
Their voting system with AV and their senate work much better than America but not ideal, but to be clear, 
I would take their system in a heartbeat. Mandatory voting is good, and their health system is great, 
probably the best philosophically and practically for America to copy. 
Costa Rica has no army, invests a lot in education and health care, is trying to be the leader on ecotourism 
and actually doing a lot to reduce fossil fuels and conserve their natural beauty.
Or you know, Canada and Switzerland have better federalism arragements. So does Belgium but in a different way. 
Canada has good immigration policy that is decentralized in many ways. 
Why are Americans so unwilling to ponder what other countries do differently?
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/notjustbikes/comments/111fxjb/poll_results_what_foreign_ways_of_doing_things/">This 
reddit thread is amazing</a> and show Americans want walkable places, VATs, minimum mandatory vacation, 
no tipping, no drug advertising on TV, better and more modern banking tech, plausibly quick boiling electric kettles, 
drinking alcohol in public places as long as you are responsible, prefilled tax returns, bidets. 
</p>
<h6>Working less in America</h6>
<p>Work podcast with Derek Thompson and Juliet Schor, health insurance structure is a fixed cost for employers 
and so to maximize productivity employers lobby against shorter working time. Unions in  America pushed 
to lower working time and America was a leader in fewest hours worked for a while. Flexibility of 
remote work and AI could really throw the entire work conversation and decision making into a new 
and unpredictable situation.  
Interesting article about <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23557282/afterschool-education-childcare-expanded-learning">after 
school care of children</a>. 
James Suzman talked with Ezra Klein about working less, and he thinks there would have to be a cultural shift 
and possibly a strong political/labor movement.
So younger generations haven’t seen<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4741448"> 
quite the income growth but per hour as older generations have</a>. Younger generations work less though, 
which explains most of the difference.

(<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bureaucracy">Bureaucracy is from a French word meaning desk</a>.) 
</p>
<h6>Long term debt problems in the United States (and welfare state spending)</h6>
<p>Mostly an issue of health costs and aging population. on the health front, adopt Finkelstein and Einav plan.
Fund with payroll tax initially to prevent too much fiscal disruption, but transition to VAT over time.
End so many deductions. See other funding problems. For aging, just need to tweak pension funding a bit. 
Also doing swiss style social security taxes would be great (equal contributions, no cap). Can even use that 
as a basis for better child benefits, disability, support for parents, etc.
<a href="https://www.vox.com/money/2023/12/18/24001984/us-budget-deficit-2023-debt-tax-revenue-interest-rates">No 
one knows when the debt will become a problem</a>. Debt was too low in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis. Now it is 
a problem, and high interest rates are also contributing to the problem. 
We could look into Swedish or Swiss debt rules if anyone is serious about debt problems. But I think 
that will require a better welfare state (and those two countries do allow countercyclical spending, aiming 
to balance the budget over the business cycle). Sweden though arguably has had too little debt in the last 
twenty years or so, based on interest rates on government bonds and excess unemployment for a while. 
The problem is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYgAghfa2gs">Medicare and Social Security growing much 
faster than revenues</a>. And that includes the TCJA cuts expiring in the next few years. Economically, 
the spending cuts should amount to about 60% of deficit problems. Do more from lesser distortionary taxes, like 
excise taxes, VATs, and removing dumb deductions. Also tax income (and corporations) less. I want to be clear 
that you could raise corporate and income taxes, but you want to go after deductions and credits first, and some 
tax enforcement wouldn't hurt either. Sooner we start addressing this, the less painful the adjustment will be. 
I love this 
<a href="https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/the-case-for-using-subsidies-for-retirement-plans-to-fix-social-security/">plan 
to eliminate subsidies for private retirement savings, and reallocating the revenue to SSA</a>. This is good because 
the subsidies mostly go the richest people who already will save enough, and it doesn't really affect national savings, 
so what is the point?. 
<p>My plan is to maximize VAT revenue, Pigouvian taxes, and employer payroll taxes except for social security benefits(uncap).
</p>
<h6>Randomness</h6>
<p><a href="https://auresnotes.com/summary-antifragile-nassim-taleb/2/">Randomness (and ability to handle randomness) 
is good</a>. Deliberately expose yourself to stress because you get used to it over time.
<a href="https://www.econtalk.org/if-life-is-random-is-it-meaningless-with-brian-klaas/">Randomness, risk, and 
resilience from Brian Klaas, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2T0kHPtjac">he

and transfer policy), grants, industrial policy, innovation, agriculture, electricity, pandemics, natural disasters, 
schools, diversity, and entertainment. With entertainment, it should definitely include algorithms, evolution, and recomendations 
(also addiction, dopamine, and patterns).

<h6>Starting notes for urbanism</h6>
<p>M Nolan Gray wrote a fantastic book about zoning called Arbitrary Lines.
In this book, he walks through the history of zoning in the United States and thinks it has utterly failed.
He proposes an alternative, which is the starting point of how to fix zoning below. 
Abolish parking requirements, maximum heights, setback requirements, FAR limits, coverage ratios, and minimum lot sizes. 
Parking requirements are bad as Donald Shoup (and others) have shown. 
Floor to area ratio (FAR) is the ratio of inside floor area to the area of the land the building sits on. 
More floors means higher FAR. Larger building on less land means 
higher FAR. Michael Eliason <a href="https://twitter.com/holz_bau/status/1615809395526598656">pointed out</a> 
how a high FAR can be bad, and that we allow too much 
building on the edges of urban areas. He thinks that the sweet spot is mid rise building with FAR under 5. 
This doesn't quite make sense to me because many cities have tall compact buildings next to each other, although 
maybe that is special because it is commercial real estate in central business districts? Michael Elias gives an 
<a href="https://www.designboom.com/architecture/mad-arkitekter-woho-wooden-skyscraper-berlin-02-13-2021/">example 
of a 29 story wood building with a FAR of about 5</a>. I think FAR is more about personal preferences and lot sizes 
and ease of splitting parcels or joing adjecent parcels. 
Coverage ratio is the percent of the parcel of land that has a building on it. This ignores multiple stories. 
More on this later, but minimum lot sizes are

Do transit oriented development around rail stations and frequent bus routes/hubs. 
Reregulate automobiles, increase gasoline taxes and car registration fees and toll roads.

<p>Good examples include Berlin, Freiburg im Breisgau, Munich, Vienna, Zurich, Basel, Milan, Paris, Strasbourg, Rennes, 
Lund is a university town on a commuter rail line close to Malmö.  
Stockholm transit oriented development challenging geography for metro high commuter rail ridership too biking in not-winter, 
Helsinki has great housing goals good transit, and very walkable. Amsterdam is Amsterdam, 
Utrecht is a university town with trams and the busiest rail station in Netherlands and an intercity rail hub, 
Almere is a recent construction on an island reclaimed from sea, 
Delft is decent size city with trams and trains between Rotterdam and Den Haag, 
Groningen innovative city smallish with lots of students,

<p>There are no excuses for doing urbanism well. See Oulu, Helsinki, Trondheim, 
Seville, Santiago, Copenhagen, Munich, Tokyo, Lisbon, Amsterdam, 
Pontevedra, Houten, Zermatt, Berlin, and Rome. </p> 
<p>The reason I say this is because people will say that you can only have good cities when the weather if favorable, 
when you have city that is flat enough or not hilly, when a city is rich enough, when it is the right size, 
and this is only for large cities not their suburbs or smaller towns. All of this is wrong. Oulu and Helsinki are 
cold and yet Oulu is pretty good for biking, including complex contracts to clear bike paths quickly when it snows. 
Helsinki isn't quite as cold, isn't quite as good for cycling, but still has lots of walking and transit. 
Trondheim is also a smaller city in northern Norway that has very high ridership for its tram and bus system.
On the other end of the spectrum, Seville Spain is notorious for being one of the hottest cities in Europe. And yet 
it is probably the cycling leader in Spain, has a good bus network, has a commuter rail network, one metro line 
(for now), and is quite walkable. They even turned one of the busiest roads in the middle of the downtown into a 
pedestrian street. They do have adaptions to the heat, like putting up cover over the busiest pedestrian streets 
in the summer. Santiago, Chile similarly is quite hot, but they still have half way decent transit and walkability it seems.
The other key point is that Santiago is not nearly as rich as any city in the United States, Europe, Asia, or Oceania
with good urbanism. Copenhagen is interesting because they became such a good urban center because the city 
was going bankrupt and had to make a ton of changes to get back to solvency, but now is thriving. 
Munich and Tokyo are great examples of how the whole region can function well as a city, with good transit to suburbs, 
(although Munich has integrated fares, but Tokyo still works relatively seemlessly), and Munich is one of the larger cities 
in Germany and Europe and is only a state capital, although it is very rich. Tokyo is one of the largest cities in the 
world, and its population keeps growing despite Japan's shrinking population. Then there are Lisbon and Amsterdam. 
Lisbon is a very hilly city that can be quite difficult to walk through with its steep hills. On the hand, Amsterdam 
and the rest of the Netherlands is very flat, Amsterdam is also quite rainy. Tokyo and the rest of Japan are built 
to withstand earthquakes and tsunamis. And lastly, size doesn't matter. Pontevedra is an amazing 
small city of less than 100000 people. 
They have pedestrianized the core of the city and have a growing population in a region and country with little or 
declining population growth. And Houten is a suburb of Utrecht that is very pleasent to walk and cycle through, along with 
having multiple train stations and the Utrecht tram system having stops in Houten too. And lastly, Zermatt is a skiing town 
in Switzerland, up in the mountains, that is very good at urbanism as well. Zermatt is a town with about 5800 people.
Berlin has the best rail system in Germany, is surprisingly not dense or that rich, but is still the capital 
of Germany. Berlin is walkable too. Although they are going backwards because of dumb political reasons. 
Seville and Rome both have many historical sites and buildings worth preserving yet they can still build metros 
and have a good urban area.

<p>Urbanism is important and connected to basically every problem in society.</p>

<h6>Starting notes for Spanish history</h6>
<p>Iberia was settled by many different people, including groups 
the Celts, Aquitanians, Basques, Lusitanians, Tartessians, Gallaecans. Ibera was partly conquered by the Carthaginians. 
Rome then destroyed Carthage and took control of its empire. Along the way, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numantine_War">Tiberius Gracchus negotiated a treaty
with the Numantians</a> (now in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numantia">province of Soria</a>, 
Castille and Leon). Tiberius Gracchus was deemed to have done badly with this treaty, 
even though he saved Romans from being slaughtered. This was one of the earliest events in his life that he is known for,
and Tiberius Gracchus was 
<a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/mike-duncan/the-storm-before-the-storm/9781478999645/?lens=publicaffairs">one 
of the key figures in the story of how Rome ended up weak enough to become an empire</a>, with Julius Caesar being the first
emperor. (The Numantians still live on in Spain, for example the name of the soccer club 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD_Numancia">CD Numancia</a>.)
Rome collapsed (slowly) and then the Goths took over the Iberian Peninsula. 
(One famous remnant of the Visigoths today in Spain is the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque%E2%80%93Cathedral_of_C%C3%B3rdoba">Mosque-Cathedral 
of Córdoba</a> (Mezquita-catedral de Córdoba) or at least part of it).
The Visigoths built a church in the city of Córdoba, and then later, Muslims built a mosque over it.)
In the 700s the Muslims conqured almost all of Iberia (minus Asturias), 
would have continued but were beaten by Charles Martel in the Battle of Tours. (There seems to have been a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_conquest_of_Spain">civil war in Spain</a> 
probably related to struggle for the throne. And some good old fashioned opportunism by the Muslims.) 
The Muslims established a capital of their Iberian territory in Cordoba. 
Fast forwarding a few centuries, Isabel of Castile and Fernando II married. Isabel faced a challenge to her rule, 
spring from the fact that her brother Enrique IV only had a daughter and Isabel had been named heir after her brother, 
Alfonso died, and was backed by more of the Castillian nobles than her niece, Juana la Beltraneja. Fernando of course 
fought off Juana la Beltraneja and her allies, while Juana had Portugal backing her, mainly because her mother was 
Portuguese and she married her uncle, King Afonso of Portugal. 
The marriage was definitely political, as it secured Isabel on the throne of Castilla, and united Castilla and Aragon. 
Also, Isabel and Fernando are called 
the <i>Reyes Catolicos</i>, or Catholic Monarchs, but Isabel was truly pious, and Fernando was Catholic 
as a convenience and for political reasons more than true piety. </p>
<p>Now back to the muslims in Iberia. The Reconquista started shortly after the 
conquest of Iberia, only ending in 1492, when Fernando and Isabel finally conquered Granada (and eventually 
were buried there). (The final phase of the war is called the Granada War, and involves betrayal, corruption, 
and a siege.) Fernando and Isabel went on to sponsor Christopher Columbus's voyage to America, also in 1492. 
(Patrick Wyman says that Columbus is the most replaceable figure in history because he didn't have unique 
naval skills of any kind, and just about anyone could have made the voyage, they just needed money to do so.) 
Fernando and Isabel had a daughter Juana la Loca who married Felipe el Hermoso, son of the Holy Roman Emperor,
and they had a son Charles V. Isabel died in 1504, at which point, Juana la Loca nominally ruled but was 
sequestered in a castle in Tordesillas while Fernando maintained the Castillian kingdom. (Isabel was probably 
not actually crazy or mad,
probably, but how can anyone maintain perfectly good health while being sequestered so long?) Meanwhile, 
Fernando wanted a son, and married a French noblewomen, Germaine de Foix. The attempt to have a son failed, 
but the throne of part of Navarra was tied to Fernando and his heirs, and the other part became part 
of the French Kingdom, and is now the French Basque Country. 
When Felipe el Hermoso died a couple months after Fernando II, Juana ruled jointly with her son Charles V,
although Charles continued the policy of keeping his mother locked away in Tordesillas.
Charles inherited the Spanish territories in the Americas, and in the Pacific,
not to mention most of the Iberian Peninsula, and had family connection to Portugal (which included
Brazil and places like Taiwain and Macau) many islands in the Mediterranean, and southern Italy. 
And since Felipe el Hermoso was the son of Maxilimilian I and Mary of Burgundy, 
Charles V inherited a chunk on land in what is now Eastern France, Burgundy, which was also possibly the richest place in 
Europe at the time, such that his grandmother was often called 'the Rich'. He also conquered the Duchy of Milan.
Through his reign, he also allied himself with the Pope, who controlled the Papel States, in central Italy.
Once his grandfather Maximilian I died, the Holy Roman Empire was up for grabs. At the time, the position was 
chosen by seven electors, who were noblemen with other titles and lands. And by chosen, I mean bribed. Charles did 
indeed pay off the electors, using money borrowed by the Castillian kingdom, which put him in massive debt. (This was 
part of the process that lead to European finance, and in this case Charles borrowed money from Jakob Fugger 
to finance the Imperial throne.) It should be noted that the Holy Roman Emperor didn't actually have that much power, 
but he had a huge base of allies he could call on (theoretically, probably had to negotiate somewhat.)  
Charles was very successful at expanding territory. He also was a huge defender of Catholicism, including 
being the one who Martin Luther met with under truce, with Charles trying to convince him to recant, and 
Martin Luther later fled from Charles. Charles also Famously fought off the Ottomans, including the 
famous Battle of Lepanto. 
In 1556, Charles was tired with life, not helped by his poor health from inbreeding, and retired to Extremadura Spain. 
He gave all his lands and titles to his son Felipe II, except the Holy Roman Empire, which he gave to his brother 
Ferdinand II. 
Felipe II moved the capital of Spain from Toledo to Madrid because it was more central. 
Unlike his father, Felipe II was very Spanish. Felipe II continued the Catholicism policies, maybe 
the most distinct part being the Battle of Lepanto. 
In the 1600s, Felipe's descendents were getting so much 
money from the gold and silver from the Americas, which went up the Guadalquivier through Cadiz and Seville. 
To this day, in the center of Seville, right next to the Cathedral of Seville, there is the 
Archivo de las Indias (Archives of the Indies), which contains most of the records of the journeys 
to the Americas and records of what they brought back. They are trying to digitize the records, slowly. 
Spain also had the best soldiers in the 1500s through middle of 1600s, the tercios. Spain was one of the princple 
nations involved in the Thirty Years War, and towards the end lost military dominance, lost money from Americas, 
lost land to France and others, Conde-Duque de Olivares was corrupt and bad, Catalonia and Portugal revolted,
and Spanish elites prioritized keeping Catalonia because they didn't want France and Catalonia allying, 
and thus lost Portugal forever. Also treaties with France and Pigeon Island. 
At the start of the 1700s, Carlos II didn't have an heir because of inbreeding,
which triggered a war of succcession. This is when Spain became united as Spain due to the Nueva Planta decrees, 
passed by King Felipe V once the war was over. As a condition of becoming the King of Spain, he renounced his place 
in the French line of succession to the throne. Even today, the monarch of Spain is a direct descendent of Felipe V, 
and a member of the House of Bourbon, the French House that Felipe V was a part of. (Side note: the current person 
who probably has the best claim to the French monarchy if it existed is also a descendent of Felipe V and has 
Bourbon ancestry. More on this later.) 
This meant Spanish, French, and Italian monarchs couldn't have more than one of those thrones. 
At this point in time, Felipe V was the grandson of Louis XIV, the Sun King, 
and second son of Louis, Grand Dauphin, oldest son of Louis XIV who died before his father.
Felipe V ended up being the closest to 
inheriting the throne, despite being from the rival French monarchy. This whole situation matters later. 
Brief Spanish republic, followed by the restoration and Alfonso XII and his son, Alfonso XIII. Also start of industrialization. 
Also the Basque Fueros, and centralization of Spain. In the 1800s there was the liberal revolutions and Isabel II. 
WWI followed by republicanism and dictatorships and turbulent political times, abdication of Alfonso XIII, Miguel 
Primo de Rivera and successors, fighting in Morocco, Civil Wars and Franco Dictatorship. Restoration of (weak) monrachy,
Juan Carlos I and Adolfo Suarez and transition to democracy. Booming economy, becoming a typical western european country. 
2008 crash and then Catalan unrest, and Covid, through 2023 elections.

<h6>Starting notes for airports and air travel and air cargo transport</h6>
<p> Berlin Brandenburg Airport and the absolute failure. <a href="https://youtu.be/qD6bPNZRRbQ?si=3IUXZLk08FvRlVna">CGP 
Grey on airport runway numbers</a>, very interesting and of course there is an international dispute about how to 
handle the moving magnetic North Pole. 
<a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-is-it-so-hard-to-build-an-airport">Airports tend to be expensive and 
take a long time to be approved, let alone constructed</a>. The main reason seems to be noise, 
and land use around the airport. Some airports were put far from city centers, but then the city sprawled out to the 
airport, for example O'Hare in Chicago. Sometimes airlines oppose new airports that will be predominantly used by a rival 
airline. Also, most comerical airports in the United States are publically owned, but in the EU there has been 
a trend toward privatizing the airports. For example, London-Heathrow is privatized. 
Airports can be huge, like 
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/7xkefe/the_actual_size_of_denver_international_airport/">Denver 
having comparable land area to the entire city of San Francisco. Denver is the largest airport by land though. 
Air traffic control <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system#Applications">uses a 
modified form of polar coordinates</a>.  
There is a thing in commercial air travel called flying standby. This is basically a way for airlines to milk out a 
few more dollars from a few passengers when the plane otherwise wouldn't be full. If you are going somewhere 
and have a very flexible schedule, you can fly standby, where you just wait to make sure that the plane going to 
your destination will not be full, and then you fly cheaper in a random seat. The downside is you cannot rely on this in 
case a normal customer comes and does book a ticket in advance. This mostly seems to be a thing for people who work or 
know someone who works in the airline industry. 
Airport security is not what you think. In America, the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_Security_Administration">TSA</a> runs airport security, 
which was created by nationalizing the industry after 9/11. It is not clear whether the TSA is actually effective 
since the agents can 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629051305/http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news%2Flocal&id=7848683">pretty 
routinely smuggle things through</a> when secretly testing other agents. 
There is also the line of thought that the TSA is really just doing 'security theater'. This means the real act of stopping 
bad otucomes comes from intelligence outside the TSA, and the TSA is just a to make people feel safe. 
On the other hand, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y1kJpHBn50">Israel uses very tough methods</a> 
of racially profiling people, making security the first thing you go through when entering the airport, 
a very personal interview, and totally willing invade privacy and to make people open their computers, phones, etc.
If you have ever walked through an airport you have probably seen "duty free" on a few stores. 
This is because there is a quirk in tax law in airports where the items sold are not subject to normal sales taxes. This is 
probably a bigger deal in European countries where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_added_tax">VAT is 
relatively high</a>, and of course this matters more for luxury products, which if you are flying, you are way more likely 
to buy because you have a higher than average income. The prices have always seemed inflated to me anyway, presumably 
because of a similar logic of stadium food, but also I don't buy the luxury items they have there in the first place. 
I do think it interesting that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Feeney">Chuck Feeney</a> became a 
billionaire by starting (with some other people) a retail chain 
that exclusively does duty-free shops in airports, and then gave away basically all of his fortune to fund education.
Lowcost airlines are a thing you might know about from Europe. There are a few things that make low cost airlines common 
in Europe. The first is that the EU has very strong antitrust laws, which the low cost airlines took advantage of. 
Another is that the US has a flat fee on every airline ticket that funds the TSA, and this makes cheap tickets 
very hard to make work. I think it also matters that more airports in Europe are privately owned, meaning more 
airports are trying to get more traffic to their airport. 
The low cost airlines generally play hardball with airports, because they aggressively negotiate cheap landing fees, 
and threaten to fly to a nearby airport instead. Low cost airlines also charge for just about everything, where as 
other lines will routinely give free checked bags or complimentary snacks and drinks on the flight. Low cost airlines 
also will not always use the gates and instead require passengers to walk from the plane to the airport, because going 
to a gate and using buses for passenger convenience costs the airline money. 
Important to note that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-Pu3CXatsA">low cost airlines have been 
losing money since Covid</a>. This seems to be primarily because fuel costs have gone up. Since the low cost airlines 
have a disproportionately large percent of their revenue going to fuel, this makes their costs (and profits) 
more dependent on the increases or decreases in fuel. Also Covid affected demand and changed (business) behavior. 

One weird thing that has happened is that large firms own large slices of each major airline in the United States. 
Because of this, Azar, Schmalz, and Tecu find that 
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2427345">common ownership of airlines is anti-competitive, 
but there are private gains because the owners of airlines have high profits</a>. This raises some interesting questions 
about firms like Vanguard and Blackrock that I won't get into right now. But it also raise the interesting question 
about whether airline tickets should be cheaper or more expensive given carbon emissions of air travel. 
To start with, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions-from-aviation">air plane emissions are 
about 2-3% of all emissions</a>, based on the most recent data. It is not the biggest chunk by far, but in the long term, 
there needs to be movement on this somehow if the goal is net zero emissions. So obviously higher fuel taxes 
and thus more expensive air travel would reduce emissions. On the other hand we generally don't like anti-competitive behavior 
in an industry, because it results in some combination of higher prices and worse service relative to the counterfactual 
more competitive alternative. Jumping back to the specifics of airlines, fuel taxes should be higher, if no other reason 
than just correcting the unpriced externalities (and a more efficient way to tax). But there also needs to be better 
alternatives, mainly trains, but also buses like Greyhound or Flixbus. And that requires a lot more state support 
to shift people to these alternatives and to make these alternatives more viable. Ideally you probably want to make it 
so no one flies less than 500 km (311 miles) or so. Or if you do, make it very very expensive. And conveniently, 
this is the range over which buses and trains are at their best relative to both cars and planes. 
There will still be challenges to places like Iceland and many poorer isolated island nations and territories, but that 
is where we need to focus more on new technology, like 
<a href="https://www.volts.wtf/p/its-time-to-get-charged-up-for-battery">better batteries</a> or 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201031121346/https://www.airbus.com/innovation/zero-emission/hydrogen/zeroe.html">better 
hydrogen fuel cells</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen-powered_aircraft">other forms of hydrogen</a>. 
It would also be useful to be able to make

<h6>electricity systems compared</h6>
<p>
Alternating current is used for electric grids. 
To start, higher voltages require less current to transfer energy. 
Higher voltages mean lower currents and smaller wires, because loss in wires =rho*l/A=rho*l/(pi*r*r). 
Smaller wires mean less losses in transmission. 
However, higher voltages are more dangerous, and more likely to arc, even if the total risk of arcing is small. 
Electricity mains mostly are 110 volts plus or minus 10% or 230 volts plus or minus 10%. Single phase to houses? 
Three phase is also used for electric grids. Why use three phase AC? 
<a href="https://www.electrical4u.com/why-supply-frequency-is-50-hz-or-60-hz/">Higher 
frequency means more power, smaller motors, transformers and other devices, more losses, and more likely to have 
harmonics which causes other problems. Higher frequency also mitigates incandescent lights flickering. 
Why France is weird.
Basically everyone is 50 or 60 hertz. Japan is split into two different systems. 
<a href="https://getpocket.com/read/343762678">Japan has two electricity standards</a>. 
One was because the Germans imported what they were using (50 Hz system) 
in the southern/western part, and the Americans imported the other system (60 Hz system) to the northern/eastern part.
Standards of electricity. 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_power_transmission_grid">Massive grid connecting 
North America</a>. 
Brazil mostly uses <a href="https://www.netio-products.com/en/glossary/type-n-electrical-socketelectrical-plug">127 volts, 
but some parts use 220 volts</a>. I assume it is due to different states adopting different standards for some reason.

Lots of copying neighbors or using colonizers' standards. Look at standardization history and first countries to electrify.

<p><a href="http://seethecat.org/ep/2019-09-17.html">Sarah Taber on the Henry George Program podcast</a> said that 
New Zealand is very land efficient in agriculture. 
Also the Hutterites might be worth looking at because they are very efficient. Most of US agriculture is based 
around low labor costs and ‘family farms’ is a myth. Commons was left over land no one wanted and there was not 
a huge population that needed more land to accommodate a large population. Also, the radical populists of the 
1800s were disgruntled labor because they were sharecroppers. She also provided support to my thesis that the US 
has terrible land use policy and doesn't care about land because the US is land abundant; she agrees but also 
lumps in water with that. </p>

War in Ukraine is bringing up questions about fertilizers, maybe do fertilizer industrial policy? 
Also ethanol is probably worse on environmental grounds than straight gasoline. 
So much food goes to feeding livestock, would be better to make food for humans.

<p>Top soil erosion first pointed out by Jeremy Grantham and it freaked me out: 
Basically need to change agricultural practices, no till farming, growing organic matter, cover crops, less pesticides and fertilizers: https://www.nrdc.org/stories/soil-erosion-101#control
Especially no till farming leaving extra crop husks alone and maybe terraces: http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2015/ph240/verso2/
Topsoil in EU common ag policy. Cover crops etc. 
Topsoil management has been bad for about 200 because of market conditions. Permafrost melting in the north 
seems related, also microbes in the permafrost? 
More on the urgency, noting it can take hundreds of years to rebuild top soil, plowing is bad, 
need to convert new practices one at a time:

<a href="https://onhumans.substack.com/p/why-agriculture"> humans started farming with climate change, 
making hunting and gathering more volatile, along with greater variation 
in seasonal weather. Farming was a way to store food and hedge against starvation. This required settling down in one place. 
Microinsurance would be better than crop insurance or transfers. It is important to note that farming was worse 
for human health than hunting and gathering was, although there were periods worse health and food availability 
than the comparable early farmers had, but there were also periods where the reverse was true.

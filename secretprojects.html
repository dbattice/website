Why Canada should annex the United States
</h6>
<p>
<a href="https://blog.supplysideliberal.com/post/60999482427/quartz-28-benjamin-franklins-strategy-to-make">More 
people make you stronger geopolitically</a>. America is a geopolitical heavyweight due to its large population 
and high incomes. Growing our population would give us more clout. Integrating more countries together 
would further science and development. Additionally this is an excuse to talk about devolution and 
parliamentarism. Canada has parliamentarism and decentralization of immigration welfare education health. 
Provincial government is better than state government because of parliamentarism and unicameralism, 
plus independent redistricting commissions. <a href="https://twitter.com/hamandcheese/status/1541963320495931392">Taxation 
is about fifty fifty, minus social security. (See Switzerland for how to do social security in a highly decentralized country.) 
Courts are not as important. Canada has lots of hydro power. The US can build fracking in Canada 
mitigating problems with Russian gas, climate change, and related issues. Canada gives media regulation 
to provinces (radio especially). 
Maximum Canada by Doug Saunders is a similar idea and <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/maximum-canada-is-happening">
Noah Smith thinks it is happening</a>. He also points out that Canada should probably do this so they can 
resist crazy America if it comes to that.
Misha Saul also <a href="https://kvetch.substack.com/p/a-new-hong-kong-in-australia">proposed to let Hong Kongers 
make their own city in Australia</a>.


</p>
<h6>current thoughts on health care policy</h6>
<p>This is mainly about reforming the health care system in the United States,probably want to copy Australia or France.
I would settle for Switzerland or Germany. I do think Beveridge is the best philosophically.<p>
<h6>What is social democracy?</h6>
<p>It really is about "working class" and labor and unions.</p>

Notes on immigration innovation and industrial policy: 
</h6>
<p><a href="https://progress.institute/">Institute for Progress</a> Niskanen Center on immigration innovation. 
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thecgo.org/research/what-policies-promote-abundance/">Center for Growth and Opportunity</a> on 
steps congress can take to increase abundance, mostly energy immigration regulations.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/the-unsung-benefits-of-h-1b-visa-fees-and-why-we-should-replicate-them/">H1-B 
visa fees</a> help fund work force training, we should expand the things that do this.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/4/3/14624918/the-case-for-immigration">Matt Yglesias</a> wrote 
a great case for immigration. The quote that sticks out is that restricting immigration wouldn't solve any 
problems, but expanding immigration could help solve problems. Also, most of the benefits of immigration 
go to the immigrants themselves.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/lessons-from-canada-private-sponsorship-can-help-refugees-land-higher-skilled-jobs/">Canada 
has a good private sponsership program</a>, and the US should copy some of its features. This helps refugees get jobs. 
We need a visa or some way to get more <a href="https://eig.org/chipmakers-visa/">immigrants who can work 
in the semiconductor industry</a> easier and faster, or it will hurt our ability to make our owns chips quickly. 

<h6>Notes on surveys, cognitive biases, and politics</h6>
<p>
Why I don’t like surveys, inflation expectations, Michigan Survey and partisanship, 
<a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2016/august/consumer-surveys-inflation-expectations-fomc">Fed 
research</a> finding that people drastically overestimate inflation, going back decades; 
<a href="https://wentingsong.com/files/macaulay_song_2022.pdf">
paper from Bank of Canada by Song and MacCauley about how twitter drives some of people’s pessimism about the economy</a>. 
<a href="https://twitter.com/AlistairMacaul7/status/1542985646507233280">Twitter thread about this</a>. 
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4266459">
I cannot believe people misunderstand supply restrictions on housing this badly</a>. 
<a href="https://twitter.com/CSElmendorf/status/1588179642841960449">They really are dumb unfortunately</a>. 
In late 2023, peole think the economy is bad, but as 
<a href="https://twitter.com/StephanieKelton/status/1732549076682445090">Stephanie 
Kelton points out</a>, they view it worse than the depths fo the 2008 recession.
Also crime, which people keep thinking is high and rising and wasn't true from early 1990s until 2020. 
Joseph Ucinsky and Michael Schermer on conspiracies. 
Conspiracies happen when you feel powerless. Internet made it easy to connect with other conspiracists. 
Conspiracies are constant but manifest differently over time. 
French believe moon landings were fake. 
Out of power party gets more conspiratorial about party in power. 
Conspiracy theories are kind of a comfort when you don’t have control. 
Collective suffering lessens psychological problems, like Londoners getting bombed in WWII. Also COVID? 
Pluralistic ignorance, 
<a href="https://psyarxiv.com/cr23g/">people hate opposite partisans for views they don’t really hold</a>, 
<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/abs/do-political-elites-have-accurate-perceptions-of-social-conditions/06DFAD98A8E9D9B7A4685BD0D9A53028">politicians 
don't really know how rich or poor their constiutents are but it probably wouldn't change much even if they did</a>, 
people wildly misperceive demographics of the other party, 
people underestimate inequality, etc. 
People with similar beliefs become more extreme when they are around people who are similar to them. 
This reminds me of positive feedback in a closed system, in which a closed system with only positive feedback is 
inherently unstable and will have larger and larger oscillations. 
It seems bad to have a political system with highly clustered ideologies and single member districts, 
but I guess that leads to wanting multimember districts, 
proportional representation, and multiple parties.</p>

<h6>Coronavirus and lessons from other countries </h6> 
<p> Conservatives citing Sweden for optimal corona policy in 2020 drove me crazy. Not only because, 
IF ONLY, but also there is lots to like about Sweden like tax policy, free college, decentralization of 
the welfare state, pensions, strong local communities, more immigrants than US. Switzerland also has 
a lot to learn from sicne Switzerland is also very decentralized and federal, but their welfare sate is much better than US. 
More generally we could learn from Costa Rica about how to not have an army and invest in health and education 
and they promote ecotourism in a lot of ways. Spain also can teach us stuff about decentralization, 
parliamentarism is good, younger generations tend to rebel and so you can learn to how to adapt to that, 
monetary policy is very important. 
Australia shows how you can have a dominant two party system, with state federal cooperation, and parliamentarism. 
Their voting system with AV and their senate work much better than America but not ideal, but to be clear, 
I would take their system in a heartbeat. Mandatory voting is good, and their health system is great, 
probably the best philosophically and practically for American to copy.
Why are Americans so unwilling to ponder what other countries do differently?
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/notjustbikes/comments/111fxjb/poll_results_what_foreign_ways_of_doing_things/">This 
reddit thread is amazing</a> and show Americans want walkable places, VATs, minimum mandatory vacation, 
no tipping, no drug advertising on TV, better more modern banking tech, plausibly quick boiling electric kettles, 
drinking alcohol in public places as long as you are responsible, prefilled tax returns, bidets. 
</p>
<h6>Long term debt problems in the United States (and welfare state spending)</h6>
<p>Mostly an issue of health costs and aging population. on the health front, adopt Finkelstein and Einav plan.
Fund with payroll tax initially to prevent too much fiscal disruption, but transition to VAT over time.
End so many deductions. See other funding problems. For aging, just need to tweak pension funding a bit. 
Also doing swiss style social security taxes would be great (equal contributions, no cap). Can even use that 
as a basis for better child benefits, disability, support for parents, etc.
<a href="https://www.vox.com/money/2023/12/18/24001984/us-budget-deficit-2023-debt-tax-revenue-interest-rates">No 
one knows when the debt will become a problem</a>. Debt was too low in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis. Now it is 
a problem, and high interest rates are also contributing to the problem. 
We could look into Swedish or Swiss debt rules if anyone is serious about debt problems. But I think 
that will require a better welfare state (and those two countries do allow countercyclical spending, aiming 
to balance the budget over the business cycle). Sweden though arguably has had too little debt in the last 
twenty years or so, based on interest rates on government bonds and excess unemployment for a while.

<h6>
Why Canada should annex the United States
</h6>
<p>
<a href="https://blog.supplysideliberal.com/post/60999482427/quartz-28-benjamin-franklins-strategy-to-make">More 
people make you stronger geopolitically</a>. America is a geopolitical heavyweight due to its large population 
and high incomes. Growing our population would give us more clout. Integrating more countries together 
would further science and development. Additionally this is an excuse to talk about devolution and 
parliamentarism. Canada has parliamentarism and 
<a href="https://twitter.com/hamandcheese/status/1534384380222836736">decentralization of immigration, welfare, 
education, and health</a>. 
Provincial government is better than state government because of parliamentarism and unicameralism, 
plus independent redistricting commissions. <a href="https://twitter.com/hamandcheese/status/1541963320495931392">Taxation 
is about fifty fifty between the federal and provincial governments, minus social security</a>. 
(See Switzerland for how to do social security in a highly decentralized country.) 
Courts are not as important. Canada has lots of hydro power. The US can build fracking in Canada 
mitigating problems with Russian gas, climate change, and related issues. Canada gives media regulation 
to provinces (radio especially). I increasingly think that Canada should annex the states one by one and 
the territories too. I first saw this as a joke about how the US should annex Canada, but I think the reverse 
should happen. The only criticism I have is that the municipal government isn’t the best, but still 
probably better because it is more centralized in the largest municipality in a metro area. 
</p>
<p>
Maximum Canada by Doug Saunders is a similar idea and <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/maximum-canada-is-happening">
Noah Smith thinks it is happening</a>. He also points out that Canada should probably do this so they can 
resist crazy America if it comes to that.
Misha Saul also <a href="https://kvetch.substack.com/p/a-new-hong-kong-in-australia">proposed to let Hong Kongers 
make their own city in Australia</a>.
</p>
<p>In addtion to this annexation, the combined country should consider annexing (at mutual agreement) a slew of 
other territories that have in the past wanted to be part of Canada or the United States. 
The one that is most controversial is Taiwan. This would immediately stop Chinese flaunting of its military near Taiwan, 
immediately help the US position on semiconductors and technology. It would give more Americans a back door to better 
urbanism, or at least examples of such. This could backfire as China gets even more paranoid and aggressive. 
But if we make it clear we are not aggressive, they have no leg to stand on. These options also apply to 
Hong Kong and Macau and Singapore, but for different economic reasons, and not as strategic geopolitically. 
These countries all have something else to contribute institutionally and culturally, while expanding geopolitical weight 
of Mega Canada.
Canada has previously talked about letting in Turks and Caicos, St.Pierra and Miquelon, Bermuda, Bahamas, and Barbados. 
Iceland has also previously discussed joining Canada. These would be fine additions with lots of raw materials, tourism, 
and more water based geopolitical power. 
The United States has discussed adding Greenland, the Mexican states of Yucatán, Quintana Roo, and Campeche 
(which is basically the Yucután peninsula), the Azores (now part of Portugal but an important point during the Cold War), 
Canary Islands (same), Baja California, and Baja California Sur (so close to California already).
</p>
<h6>current thoughts on health care policy</h6>
<p>This is mainly about reforming the health care system in the United States,probably want to copy Australia or France.
I would settle for Switzerland or Germany. (See Professor Busse on Germany.) 
I do think Beveridge is the best philosophically, mainly because 
the incentives of people and the government are high quality or effectiveness at low costs overall.<p>

problems, but expanding immigration could help solve problems. Also, most of the benefits of immigration 
go to the immigrants themselves.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/lessons-from-canada-private-sponsorship-can-help-refugees-land-higher-skilled-jobs/">Canada

Immigration for STEM graduate degrees: Institute for Progress, why are the rules like this? 
Students come here graduate why not give them an automatic visas upon graduation. Startup visas,

<h6>Surveys, cognitive biases, and politics</h6>
<p>
Why I don’t like surveys, inflation expectations, Michigan Survey and partisanship, 
<a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2016/august/consumer-surveys-inflation-expectations-fomc">Fed 
research</a> finding that people drastically overestimate inflation, going back decades; 
<a href="https://wentingsong.com/files/macaulay_song_2022.pdf">
paper from Bank of Canada by Song and MacCauley about how twitter drives some of people’s pessimism about the economy</a>. 
<a href="https://twitter.com/AlistairMacaul7/status/1542985646507233280">Twitter thread about this</a>. 
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4266459">
I cannot believe people misunderstand supply restrictions on housing this badly</a>. 
<a href="https://twitter.com/CSElmendorf/status/1588179642841960449">They really are dumb unfortunately</a>. 
In late 2023, peole think the economy is bad, but as 
<a href="https://twitter.com/StephanieKelton/status/1732549076682445090">Stephanie 
Kelton points out</a>, they view it worse than the depths fo the 2008 recession. 
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@paulkrugman7/post/C2FenDZOvx3">Paul Krugman also points out that Republicans are 
worse at this in 2023 and that most people say they are doing fine</a>. (Republican point isn't suprising to me). 
Also crime, which people keep thinking is high and rising and wasn't true from early 1990s until 2020. 
Joseph Ucinsky and Michael Schermer on conspiracies. 
Conspiracies happen when you feel powerless. Internet made it easy to connect with other conspiracists. 
Conspiracies are constant but manifest differently over time. 
French believe moon landings were fake. 
Out of power party gets more conspiratorial about party in power. 
Conspiracy theories are kind of a comfort when you don’t have control. 
Collective suffering lessens psychological problems, like Londoners getting bombed in WWII. Also COVID? 
Pluralistic ignorance, 
<a href="https://psyarxiv.com/cr23g/">people hate opposite partisans for views they don’t really hold</a>, 
<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/abs/do-political-elites-have-accurate-perceptions-of-social-conditions/06DFAD98A8E9D9B7A4685BD0D9A53028">politicians 
don't really know how rich or poor their constiutents are but it probably wouldn't change much even if they did</a>, 
people wildly misperceive demographics of the other party, 
people underestimate inequality, etc. 
People with similar beliefs become more extreme when they are around people who are similar to them. 
This reminds me of positive feedback in a closed system, in which a closed system with only positive feedback is 
inherently unstable and will have larger and larger oscillations. 
It seems bad to have a political system with highly clustered ideologies and single member districts, 
but I guess that leads to wanting multimember districts, 
proportional representation, and multiple parties.</p>

<h6>Coronavirus and lessons from other countries </h6> 
<p> Conservatives citing Sweden for optimal corona policy in 2020 drove me crazy. Not only because, 
IF ONLY, but also there is lots to like about Sweden like tax policy, free college, decentralization of 
the welfare state, pensions, strong local communities, more immigrants than US. Switzerland also has 
a lot to learn from sicne Switzerland is also very decentralized and federal, but their welfare sate is much better than US. 
More generally we could learn from Costa Rica about how to not have an army and invest in health and education 
and they promote ecotourism in a lot of ways. Spain also can teach us stuff about decentralization, 
parliamentarism is good, younger generations tend to rebel and so you can learn to how to adapt to that, 
monetary policy is very important. 
Australia shows how you can have a dominant two party system, with state federal cooperation, and parliamentarism. 
Their voting system with AV and their senate work much better than America but not ideal, but to be clear, 
I would take their system in a heartbeat. Mandatory voting is good, and their health system is great, 
probably the best philosophically and practically for America to copy. 
Costa Rica has no army, invests a lot in education and health care, is trying to be the leader on ecotourism 
and actually doing a lot to reduce fossil fuels and conserve their natural beauty.
Or you know, Canada and Switzerland have better federalism arragements. So does Belgium but in a different way. 
Canada has good immigration policy that is decentralized in many ways. 
Why are Americans so unwilling to ponder what other countries do differently?
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/notjustbikes/comments/111fxjb/poll_results_what_foreign_ways_of_doing_things/">This 
reddit thread is amazing</a> and show Americans want walkable places, VATs, minimum mandatory vacation, 
no tipping, no drug advertising on TV, better more modern banking tech, plausibly quick boiling electric kettles, 
drinking alcohol in public places as long as you are responsible, prefilled tax returns, bidets. 
</p>
<h6>Working less in America</h6>
<p>Work podcast with Derek Thompson and Juliet Schor, health insurance structure is a fixed cost for employers 
and so to maximize productivity employers lobby against shorter working time. Unions in  America pushed 
to lower working time and America was a leader in fewest hours worked for a while. Flexibility of 
remote work and AI could really throw the entire work conversation and decision making into a new 
and unpredictable situation.  
Interesting article about <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23557282/afterschool-education-childcare-expanded-learning">after 
school care of children</a>. 
James Suzman talked with Ezra Klein about working less, and he thinks there would have to be a cultural shift 
and possibly a strong political/labor movement.

Americans work so much, development of Germany, Denmark, Norway, New Zealand Australia having vacation time paid sick leave. 
Mankiw reviews some literature suggesting that taxes play a role, but then again US labor tax wedges and burdens are 
kind of low but even New Zealand's are smaller and they work less.

<a href="https://twitter.com/JonSteinsson/status/1728899585157087604">Jon Steinsson suspects</a> 
it is because we can’t all coordinate working less, and unions are the main coordinating factor. 
Apparently <a href="https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/1614234484311826432">hard working men had the greatest

<h6>Long term debt problems in the United States (and welfare state spending)</h6>
<p>Mostly an issue of health costs and aging population. on the health front, adopt Finkelstein and Einav plan.
Fund with payroll tax initially to prevent too much fiscal disruption, but transition to VAT over time.
End so many deductions. See other funding problems. For aging, just need to tweak pension funding a bit. 
Also doing swiss style social security taxes would be great (equal contributions, no cap). Can even use that 
as a basis for better child benefits, disability, support for parents, etc.
<a href="https://www.vox.com/money/2023/12/18/24001984/us-budget-deficit-2023-debt-tax-revenue-interest-rates">No 
one knows when the debt will become a problem</a>. Debt was too low in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis. Now it is 
a problem, and high interest rates are also contributing to the problem. 
We could look into Swedish or Swiss debt rules if anyone is serious about debt problems. But I think 
that will require a better welfare state (and those two countries do allow countercyclical spending, aiming 
to balance the budget over the business cycle). Sweden though arguably has had too little debt in the last 
twenty years or so, based on interest rates on government bonds and excess unemployment for a while. 
</p>

<h6>Starting notes for urbanism</h6>
<p>M Nolan Gray wrote a fantastic book about zoning called Arbitrary Lines.
In this book, he walks through the history of zoning in the United States and thinks it has utterly failed.
He proposes an alternative, which is the starting point of how to fix zoning below. 
Abolish parking requirements, maximum heights, setback requirements, FAR limits, coverage ratios, and minimum lot sizes. 
Parking requirements are bad as Donald Shoup (and others) have shown. 
Floor to area ratio (FAR) is the ratio of inside floor area to the area of the land the building sits on. 
More floors means higher FAR. Larger building on less land means 
higher FAR. Michael Eliason <a href="https://twitter.com/holz_bau/status/1615809395526598656">pointed out</a> 
how a high FAR can be bad, and that we allow too much 
building on the edges of urban areas. He thinks that the sweet spot is mid rise building with FAR under 5. 
This doesn't quite make sense to me because many cities have tall compact buildings next to each other, although 
maybe that is special because it is commercial real estate in central business districts? Michael Elias gives an 
<a href="https://www.designboom.com/architecture/mad-arkitekter-woho-wooden-skyscraper-berlin-02-13-2021/">example 
of a 29 story wood building with a FAR of about 5</a>. I think FAR is more about personal preferences and lot sizes 
and ease of splitting parcels or joing adjecent parcels. 
Coverage ratio is the percent of the parcel of land that has a building on it. This ignores multiple stories. 
More on this later, but minimum lot sizes are 
<a href="https://www.marketurbanism.com/2022/10/20/is-affordability-just-you-get-what-you-pay-for/">indeed restrictive</a>. 
A paper by  Gyorko and McCulloch shows that minimum lot sizes <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31710">increase home size, 
but reduce density</a>. <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/research/policy-briefs/housing-reform-states-menu-options-2024">Many good recommendations 
here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Do transit oriented development around rail stations and frequent bus routes/hubs. 
Reregulate automobiles, increase gasoline taxes and car registration fees and toll roads.
</p>
<p>Good examples include Berlin, Freiburg im Breisgau, Munich, Vienna, Zurich, Basel, Milan, Paris, Strasbourg, Rennes, 
Lund is a university town on a commuter rail line close to Malmö.  
Stockholm transit oriented development challenging geography for metro high commuter rail ridership too biking in not-winter, 
Helsinki has great housing goals good transit, and very walkable. Amsterdam is Amsterdam, 
Utrecht is a university town with trams and the busiest rail station in Netherlands and an intercity rail hub, 
Almere is a recent construction on an island reclaimed from sea, 
Delft is decent size city with trams and trains between Rotterdam and Den Haag, 
Groningen innovative city smallish with lots of students, 
Ghent history on car free center and politics there of.
Dordrecht smaller towns connected to bigger city, near nature, historical
Roosendaal seems to be commuter town with cross border trains
Seville biking metro walkable center outer areas are good too pedestrianized avenida de la constitución, 
Madrid metro is great, Barcelona metro is great improving biking, 
Pontevedra small city car free center people walk a lot, 
Prague eastern europe metro and commuter rail horrible for cars though, Brno has super high tram ridership, 
London innovative on fares, large city with good transit, 
New York City extensive 24 hour metro plus buses and biking very walkable, 
Toronto decent subway improving the GO transit to be an S-Bahn does have density in center but politics screw up the city, 
Auckland upzoning and transit, 
Vancouver very frequent metro can be expanded walkable city, Tokyo is Tokyo, 
Seoul cheap construction very good subway, 
Hong Kong has a private, very profitable metro.</p>
<p>There are no excuses for doing urbanism well. See Oulu, Helsinki, Trondheim, 
Seville, Santiago, Copenhagen, Munich, Tokyo, Lisbon, Amsterdam, 
Pontevedra, Houten, Zermatt, Berlin, and Rome. </p> 
<p>The reason I say this is because people will say that you can only have good cities when the weather if favorable, 
when you have city that is flat enough or not hilly, when a city is rich enough, when it is the right size, 
and this is only for large cities not their suburbs or smaller towns. All of this is wrong. Oulu and Helsinki are 
cold and yet Oulu is pretty good for biking, including complex contracts to clear bike paths quickly when it snows. 
Helsinki isn't quite as cold, isn't quite as good for cycling, but still has lots of walking and transit. 
Trondheim is also a smaller city in northern Norway that has very high ridership for its tram and bus system.
On the other end of the spectrum, Seville Spain is notorious for being one of the hottest cities in Europe. And yet 
it is probably the cycling leader in Spain, has a good bus network, has a commuter rail network, one metro line 
(for now), and is quite walkable. They even turned one of the busiest roads in the middle of the downtown into a 
pedestrian street. They do have adaptions to the heat, like putting up cover over the busiest pedestrian streets 
in the summer. Santiago, Chile similarly is quite hot, but they still have half way decent transit and walkability it seems.
The other key point is that Santiago is not nearly as rich as any city in the United States, Europe, Asia, or Oceania
with good urbanism. Copenhagen is interesting because they became such a good urban center because the city 
was going bankrupt and had to make a ton of changes to get back to solvency, but now is thriving. 
Munich and Tokyo are great examples of how the whole region can function well as a city, with good transit to suburbs, 
(although Munich has integrated fares, but Tokyo still works relatively seemlessly), and Munich is one of the larger cities 
in Germany and Europe and is only a state capital, although it is very rich. Tokyo is one of the largest cities in the 
world, and its population keeps growing despite Japan's shrinking population. Then there are Lisbon and Amsterdam. 
Lisbon is a very hilly city that can be quite difficult to walk through with its steep hills. On the hand, Amsterdam 
and the rest of the Netherlands is very flat, Amsterdam is also quite rainy. Tokyo and the rest of Japan are built 
to withstand earthquakes and tsunamis. And lastly, size doesn't matter. Pontevedra is an amazing 
small city of less than 100000 people. 
They have pedestrianized the core of the city and have a growing population in a region and country with little or 
declining population growth. And Houten is a suburb of Utrecht that is very pleasent to walk and cycle through, along with 
having multiple train stations and the Utrecht tram system having stops in Houten too. And lastly, Zermatt is a skiing town 
in Switzerland, up in the mountains, that is very good at urbanism as well. Zermatt is a town with about 5800 people.
Berlin has the best rail system in Germany, is surprisingly not dense or that rich, but is still the capital 
of Germany. Berlin is walkable too. Although they are going backwards because of dumb political reasons. 
Seville and Rome both have many historical sites and buildings worth preserving yet they can still build metros 
and have a good urban area. 
</p>
<p>Urbanism is important and connected to basically every problem in society.</p>

<h6>Starting notes for Spanish history</h6>
<p>Iberia was settled by many different people, including groups 
the Celts, Aquitanians, Basques, Lusitanians, Tartessians, Gallaecans. Ibera was partly conquered by the Carthaginians. 
Rome then destroyed Carthage and took control of its empire. Along the way, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numantine_War">Tiberius Gracchus negotiated a treaty
with the Numantians</a> (now in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numantia">province of Soria</a>, 
Castille and Leon). Tiberius Gracchus was deemed to have done badly with this treaty, 
even though he saved Romans from being slaughtered. This was one of the earliest events in his life that he is known for,
and Tiberius Gracchus was 
<a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/mike-duncan/the-storm-before-the-storm/9781478999645/?lens=publicaffairs">one 
of the key figures in the story of how Rome ended up weak enough to become an empire</a>, with Julius Caesar being the first
emperor. (The Numantians still live on in Spain, for example the name of the soccer club 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD_Numancia">CD Numancia</a>.)
Rome collapsed (slowly) and then the Goths took over the Iberian Peninsula. 
(One famous remnant of the Visigoths today in Spain is the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque%E2%80%93Cathedral_of_C%C3%B3rdoba">Mosque-Cathedral 
of Córdoba</a> (Mezquita-catedral de Córdoba).
The Visigoths built a church in the city of Córdoba, and then later, Muslims built a mosque over it.)
In the 700s the Muslims conqured almost all of Iberia (minus Asturias), 
would have continued but were beaten by Charles Martel in the Battle of Tours. (There seems to have been a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_conquest_of_Spain">civil war in Spain</a> 
probably related to struggle for the throne. And some good old fashioned opportunism by the Muslims.) 
The Muslims established a capital of their Iberian territory in Cordoba. 
Fast forwarding a few centuries, Isabel of Castile and Fernando II married. Isabel faced a challenge to her rule, 
and Fernando helped secure the throne? 
The marriage was definitely political, as it secrued Isabel on the throne of Castilla. Also, they are called 
the <i>Reyes Catolicos</i>, or Catholic Monarchs, but Isabel was absolutely pious, and Fernando was Catholic 
as a convenience, for political reasons more than true piety. The Reconquista started shortly after the 
conquest of Iberia, only ending in 1492, when Fernando and Isabel finally conquered Granada (and eventually 
were buried there). (The final phase of the war is called the Granada War, and involves betrayal, corruption, 
and a siege.) They went on to sponsor Christopher Columbus's voyage to America. (Patrick Wyman says that 
Columbus is the most replaceable figure in history.) 
Fernando and Isabel had a daughter Juana la Loca who married Felipe el Hermoso, son of the Holy Roman Emperor,
and they had a son Charles V. Isabel died in 1504, at which point, Juana la Loca nominally ruled but was 
sequestered in a castle in Tordesillas while Fernando maintained the Castillian kingdom. (Not actually crazy,
probably, but how can anyone maintain perfectly good health while being secuestered so long?) Meanwhile, 
Fernando wanted a son, and married a French noblewomen, Germaine de Foix. The attempt to have a son failed, 
but the throne of part of Navarra was tied to Fernando and his heirs, and the other part became part of the French Kingdom. 
When Felipe el Hermoso died a couple months after Fernando II, Juana ruled jointly with her son Charles V,
although Charles continued to policy of keeping his mother locked away in Tordesillas.
Charles became the king of almost everywhere except most of modern France and the British Isles. 
Charles inherited the Spanish territories in the Americas, and in the Pacific,
not to mention most of the Iberian Peninsula, and had family connection to Portugal (which included
Brazil and places like Taiwain and Macau) many islands in the Mediterranean, and southern Italy. 
And since Felipe el Hermoso was the son of Maxilimilian I and Mary of Burgundy, 
Charles V inherited a chunk on land in what is now Eastern France. Burgundy was also possibly the richest place in 
Europe at the time, such that his mother was often called 'the Rich'. He also conquered the Duchy of Milan.
Once his grandfather Maximilian I died, the Holy Roman Empire was up for grabs. At the time, the position was 
chosen by seven electors, who were noblemen with other titles and lands. And by chosen, I mean bribed. Charles did 
indeed pay off the electors, using money borrowed by the Castillian kingdom, which put him in massive debt. (This was 
part of the process that lead to European finance, and in this case Charles borrowed money from Jakob Fugger 
to finance the Imperial throne.) It should be noted that the Holy Roman Emperor didn't actually have that much power, 
but he had a huge base of allies he could call on (theoretically, probably had to negotiate somewhat.)  
Charles was very successful at expanding territory. He also was a huge defender of Catholicism, including 
being the one who Martin Luther argued with and fled from later, and also fought off the Ottomans, including the 
famous Battle of Lepanto. 
In 1556, Charles was tired with life, not helped by his poor health from inbreeding, and retired to Extremadura Spain. 
He gave all his lands and titles to his son Felipe, except the Holy Roman Empire, which he gave to his brother 
Ferdinand II. 
Charles had a son Felipe II,
who moved the capital of Spain from Toledo to Madrid because it was more central. 
In the 1600s, Felipe's descendents were getting so much 
money from the gold and silver from the Americas, which went up the Guadalquivier through Cadiz and Seville. 
Spain also had the best soldiers in the 1500s through middle of 1600s, the tercios. Spain was one of the princple 
nations involved in the Thirty Years War, and towards the end lost military dominance, lost money from Americas, 
lost land to France and others, Conde-Duque de Olivares was corrupt and bad, Catalonia and Portugal revolted,
and Spanish elites prioritized keep Catalonia because they didn't want France and Catalonia allying, 
and thus lost Portugal forever. Also treaties with France and Pigeon Island. 
At the start of the 1700s, Carlos II didn't have an heir because of inbreeding,
which triggered a war of succcession. This is when Spain became united as Spain due to the Nueva Planta decrees.
This meant Spanish, French, and Italian monarchs couldn't have more than one of those thrones. This matters later. 
Brief Spanish republic, followed by the restoration and Alfonso XII and his son, Alfonso XIII. Also start of industrialization. 
Also the Basque Fueros, and centralization of Spain. In the 1800s there was the liberal revolutions and Isabel II. 
WWI followed by republicanism and dictatorships and turbulent political times, abdication of Alfonso XIII, Miguel 
Primo de Rivera and successors, fighting in Morocco, Civil Wars and Franco Dictatorship. Restoration of (weak) monrachy,
Juan Carlos I and Adolfo Suarez and transition to democracy. Booming economy, becoming a typical western european country.

<h6>Starting notes for airports and air travel and air cargo transport</h6>
<p> Berlin Brandenburg Airport and the absolute failure. <a href="https://youtu.be/qD6bPNZRRbQ?si=3IUXZLk08FvRlVna">CGP 
Grey on airport runway numbers</a>, very interesting and of course there is an international dispute about how to 
handle the moving magnetic North Pole. 
Air traffic control <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system#Applications">uses a 
modified form of polar coordinates</a>.  
There is a thing in commercial air travel called flying standby. This is basically a way for airlines to milk out a 
few more dollars from a few passengers when the plane otherwise wouldn't be full. If you are going somewhere 
and have a very flexible schedule, you can fly standby, where you just wait to make sure that the plane going to 
your destination will not be full, and then you fly cheaper in a random seat. The downside is you cannot rely on this in 
case a normal customer comes and does book a ticket in advance. This mostly seems to be a thing for people who work or 
know someone who works in the airline industry. 
Airport security is not what you think. In America, the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_Security_Administration">TSA</a> runs airport security, 
which was created by nationalizing the industry after 9/11. It is not clear whether the TSA is actually effective 
since the agents can 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629051305/http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news%2Flocal&id=7848683">pretty 
routinely smuggle things through</a> when secretly testing other agents. 
There is also the line of thought that the TSA is really just doing 'security theater'. This means the real act of stopping 
bad otucomes comes from intelligence outside the TSA, and the TSA is just a to make people feel safe. 
On the other hand, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y1kJpHBn50">Israel uses very tough methods</a> 
of racially profiling people, making security the first thing you go through when entering the airport, 
a very personal interview, and totally willing invade privacy and to make people open their computers, phones, etc.
If you have ever walked through an airport you have probably seen "duty free" on a few stores. 
This is because there is a quirk in tax law in airports where the items sold are not subject to normal sales taxes. This is 
probably a bigger deal in European countries where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_added_tax">VAT is 
relatively high, and of course this matters more for luxury products, which if you are flying, you are way more likely 
to buy because you have a higher than average income. The prices have always seemed inflated to me anyway, presumably 
because of a similar logic of stadium food, but also I don't buy the luxury items they have there in the first place. 
I do think it interesting that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Feeney">Chuck Feeney</a> became a 
billionaire by starting (with some other people) a retail chain 
that exclusively does duty-free shops in airports, and then gave away basically all of his fortune to fund education.
Lowcost airlines are a thing you might know about from Europe. There are a few things that make low cost airlines common 
in Europe. The first is that the EU has very strong antitrust laws, which the low cost airlines took advantage of. 
Another is that the US has a flat fee on every airline ticket that funds the TSA, and this makes cheap tickets 
very hard to make work. I think it also matters that more airports in Europe are privately owned, meaning more 
airports are trying to get more traffic to their airport. 
The low cost airlines generally play hardball with airports, because they aggressively negotiate cheap landing fees, 
and threaten to fly to a nearby airport instead. Low cost airlines also charge for just about everything, where as 
other lines will routinely give free checked bags or complimentary snacks and drinks on the flight. Low cost airlines 
also will not always use the gates and instead require passengers to walk from the plane to the airport, because going 
to a gate and using buses for passenger convenience costs the airline money.
One weird thing that has happened is that large firms own large slices of each major airline in the United States. 
Because of this, Azar, Schmalz, and Tecu find that 
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2427345">common ownership of airlines is anti-competitive, 
but there are private gains because the owners of airlines have high profits</a>. This raises some interesting questions 
about firms like Vanguard and Blackrock that I won't get into right now. But it also raise the interesting question 
about whether airline tickets should be cheaper or more expensive given carbon emissions of air travel. 
To start with, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions-from-aviation">air plane emissions are 
about 2-3% of all emissions</a>, based on the most recent data. It is not the biggest chunk by far, but in the long term, 
there needs to be movement on this somehow if the goal is net zero emissions. So obviously higher fuel taxes 
and thus more expensive air travel would reduce emissions. On the other hand we generally don't like anti-competitive behavior 
in an industry, because it results in some combination of higher prices and worse service relative to the counterfactual 
more competitive alternative. Jumping back to the specifics of airlines, fuel taxes should be higher, if no other reason 
than just correcting the unpriced externalities (and a more efficient way to tax). But there also needs to be better 
alternatives, mainly trains, but also buses like Greyhound or Flixbus. And that requires a lot more state support 
to shift people to these alternatives and to make these alternatives more viable. Ideally you probably want to make it 
so no one flies less than 500 km (311 miles) or so. Or if you do, make it very very expensive. And conveniently, 
this is the range over which buses and trains are at their best relative to both cars and planes. 
There will still be challenges to places like Iceland and many poorer isolated island nations and territories, but that 
is where we need to focus more on new technology, like 
<a href="https://www.volts.wtf/p/its-time-to-get-charged-up-for-battery">better batteries</a> or 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201031121346/https://www.airbus.com/innovation/zero-emission/hydrogen/zeroe.html">better

<h6>electricity systems compared</h6>
<p>
Alternating current is used for electric grids. 
To start, higher voltages require less current to transfer energy. 
Higher voltages mean lower currents and smaller wires, because loss in wires =rho*l/A=rho*l/(pi*r*r). 
Smaller wires mean less losses in transmission. 
However, higher voltages are more dangerous, and more likely to arc, even if the total risk of arcing is small. 
Electricity mains mostly are 110 volts plus or minus 10% or 230 volts plus or minus 10%. Single phase to houses? 
Three phase is also used for electric grids. Why use three phase AC? 
<a href="https://www.electrical4u.com/why-supply-frequency-is-50-hz-or-60-hz/">Higher 
frequency means more power, smaller motors, transformers and other devices, more losses, and more likely to have 
harmonics which causes other problems. Higher frequency also mitigates incandescent lights flickering. 
Why France is weird.
Basically everyone is 50 or 60 hertz. Japan is split into two different systems. 
<a href="https://getpocket.com/read/343762678">Japan has two electricity standards</a>. 
One was because the Germans imported what they were using (50 Hz system) 
in the southern/western part, and the Americans imported the other system (60 Hz system) to the northern/eastern part.
Standards of electricity. 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_power_transmission_grid">Massive grid connecting 
North America</a>. 
Brazil mostly uses <a href="https://www.netio-products.com/en/glossary/type-n-electrical-socketelectrical-plug">127 volts, 
but some parts use 220 volts</a>. I assume it is due to different states adopting different standards for some reason.
Transmission and transformers. 
Lots of copying neighbors or using colonizers' standards. Look at standardization history and first countries to electrify. 
</p>
<h6>Trains </h6>
<p>
There is electricity to trains, (and substations) which face normal power tradeoffs. 
AC power can have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U9Nbe_L0eg">greater distances between substations</a>.
DC voltage is more efficient but transmission is more expensive (related to why most metros are DC voltage?). 
DC voltage is better for longer distances too? 
The <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektrificatie_van_spoorlijnen_in_Nederland">Netherlands choose</a> 
1.5 kV DC because it was easier to have lower voltage and provided more benefits over AC.</p> 
<p><a href="https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/heres-why-dc-is-used-in-most-trains-over-ac">Diesel electric trains 
are very common</a>, meaning that diesel powers the train, but the power output is put into a DC generator and then DC motors, 
which then powers the train wheels. This is because <a href="https://www.parvalux.com/us/advantages-of-dc-motors/">DC motors 
are easy to control and start with high torque</a>.They are also 
<a href="https://www.swartzengineering.com/Here%E2%80%99s-Why-DC-Is-Used-In-Most-Trains-Over-AC">cheap to manufacture 
and operate</a>.</p>
<p>To get power to trains, you can either use catenary and pantographs (overhead wires) or use a third rail. 
Overhead wires also have a mechanism to rotate the wires so the wire doesn't wear out on one side from repeated contact 
with the train. Third rails are common for metro systems. They do have to have more protection because of the live electricity, 
so they are not as common on longer or intercity lines.</p>
<p>Then there is the electric power on board and to the motors, which will run power from the external source 
into rectifiers and inverters plus other things 
to get the desired voltage and current to the electric motors (and also convert some power for on board lights, screens, 
outlets, etc.).
<a href="http://railsystem.net/electric-traction-systems/">Here</a> are some diagrams of AC and DC electrification, 
assuming the motor runs on DC power.</p>
<p>Electric trains are driven by electric motors, specifically called tractions motors.
Traction motors used to be only series wound DC motors because they were easy to control. 
Series wound DC motors mean that the <a href="https://www.electricity-magnetism.org/series-wound-dc-motors/">windings 
in the armature and the field windings</a> are in series with each other. The field windings are the stationary coils 
around the stator, and the armature is the electrical connection on the moving rotor connected to the brushes. 
This results in <a href="https://www.eeworldonline.com/motor-fundamentals-dc-motors-faq/">high current and high starting 
torque</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_motor">making it ideal for accelerating a (heavy) train</a>. 
In the last few decades they are using AC motors. 
<a href="https://www.powerelectronictips.com/faq-on-traction-motors-part-2/">AC motors are used</a> because 
there are better electronics now to control and optimize the motors, have lower maintenance costs, and 
have less weight for the same power output.  There are both AC induction motors,
and synchronous AC motors (like on the TGV in France). Also, 
<a href="https://www.powerelectronictips.com/faq-on-traction-motors-part-3/">permanent magnet synchronous motors</a>. 
Also single phase vs three phase synchronous AC motors?
Note that the power to the electric motors on board can be DC or AC, 
or even converted from AC to DC, then to AC at the motors. To convert from DC power to AC motors, power is run through 
an inverter and a variable frequency drive. To convert from AC power to DC motors, the power is run through rectifiers.

</p>
<p>
The important things about electric motors are the frequency, the voltage, 
and the input power. 
AC motors will use the frequecy directly and on trains this usally aligns to the country's main electricity source frequency
(50 or 60 hertz) 
while having AC voltage of 15 or 25 kilovolts. The main exceptions here are Germany, Sweden, Norway, Austria, and Switzerland 
(16.7 Hz, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_kV_AC_railway_electrification">which used to be 16 and 2/3, 
which is exactly 1/3 of their electricity grid frequency of 50 hertz</a>). 
</p>
<p>So I was looking at train electrication and WTF <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acela">Acela</a>? 
Why do you have three different electrified systems, including different frequencies and 12 and 12.5 kilovolts on 
different segments of the route? 
This led me down a rabbit hole looking at the history of the Northeast Corridor. 
So the NEC was really merged into Amtrak and all the constituent lines were built by different companies 
at different times with different technologies and they sometimes copied nearby examples, 
like the Pennsylvania railroad which copied the New York New Haven and Hartford Railroad lines with 11 kV AC 25 Hz. 
This electrification was deemed good enough in the early 1900s because we weren’t as good at electrification 
technology and struggled to make electrification work over longer distances, even though today it is much easier 
and cheaper and more efficient. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amtrak%27s_25_Hz_traction_power_system">This 
is why basically from New York City to DC and also SEPTA and 
also parts of lines in Connecticut use 25 Hz</a>, even though the rest of the NEC is 60 Hz.
In fact, there was a Connecticut supreme court decision banning third rail because it was too dangerous. 
This led to some experimentation by the New York New Haven and Hartford Line, where they 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification_of_the_New_York,_New_Haven,_and_Hartford_Railroad">settled on 
11 kilovolts AC as the optimal electrification system</a>, (AC being chosen because of the longer distances 
and third rail DC not an option). 25 Hz was chosen because there were several other lines already using 25 Hz, 
even though they thought that 15 Hz was better if you could start from scratch, due to lower losses. 
In the 1970s there was a plan to move the 25 Hz system to 60 Hz, but was deemed to expensive. 
Instead the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amtrak%27s_25_Hz_traction_power_system">voltage 
was increased from 11 kV to 12 kV</a>.
Also, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Jersey_Coast_Line">part of the NEC in New Jersey 
was originally the 11 kV AC 25 Hz</a>, but was moved to 12 kV 25 Hz AC in the 1970s, and now is 25 kV 60 Hz AC.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification_of_the_New_York,_New_Haven_and_Hartford_Railroad">Metro North</a>, 
which shares some of the NEC track, was converted from the 11 kV AC 25 Hz to 12 kV 25 Hz AC, 
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Haven_Line">then upgraded to 12.5 kV AC 60 Hz in the late 1980s 
when a power station got shut down for some reason</a>?
In the early 1990s, Congress passed a law to 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amtrak%27s_60_Hz_traction_power_system">convert Boston to New York</a> on the NEC 
to 25 kV AC 60 Hz. This was done to improve Amtrak solvency and reduce trip times. 
So that is a basic outline of why, which then leads to the question of why not standardize to 25 kV AC instead of 
12.5 kV AC or go even further and make the whole NEC 25 kV AC? The most obvious answer is that rewiring 
the hundreds of miles of 12kV 25 Hz would be very expensive for minimal gain, even though it would make 
people like me happy to see one unified electrification system. Also, there really isn't anything wrong 
with the current system other than new trains require slightly higher costs to be able to run on all three 
electrification systems. Also, 
<a href="https://railroad.net/25-kv-60-hz-ac-on-the-entire-northeast-corridor-t171590.html">increasing the voltage 
would require more clearance between the overhead wires and the train</a>, 
which would require a lot of work to make that extra room where ever that situation occurs. 
I still think it would be worth exploring making the 12.5 kV AC match the 25 kV AC like the rest of the NEC 
north of New York City, but that requires coordination with Metro-North and would probably have to be funded by Amtrak 
or the federal government to get them to agree. I would like to see a cost estimate of this though.

Sarah Taber on the Henry George Program podcast said that NZ is very land efficient in agriculture. Also the Hutterites might be worth looking at because they are very efficient. Most of US agriculture is based around low labor costs and ‘family farms’ is a myth. Commons was left over land no one wanted and there was not a huge population that needed more land to accommodate a large population. Also, the radical populists of the 1800s were disgruntled labor because they were sharecroppers. She also provided support to my thesis that the US has terrible land use policy and doesn't care about land because the US is land abundant; she agrees but also lumps in water with that.

JD Schoulten has some ideas to investigate.
War in Ukraine is bringing up questions about fertilizers, maybe do fertilizer industrial policy? 
Also ethanol is probably worse on environmental grounds than straight gasoline. 
So much food goes to feeding livestock, would be better to make food for humans.

<p>Top soil erosion first pointed out by Jeremy Grantham and it freaked me out: 
Basically need to change agricultural practices, no till farming, growing organic matter, cover crops, less pesticides and fertilizers: https://www.nrdc.org/stories/soil-erosion-101#control
Especially no till farming leaving extra crop husks alone and maybe terraces: http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2015/ph240/verso2/
Topsoil in EU common ag policy. Cover crops etc. 
Topsoil management has been bad for about 200 because of market conditions. Permafrost melting in the north 
seems related, also microbes in the permafrost? 
More on the urgency, noting it can take hundreds of years to rebuild top soil, plowing is bad, 
need to convert new practices one at a time:

Apparently we can use manure and other biotech:

Dutch farmer protests over nitrogen, what can happen?
Intercropping or maslin seems important.

<p>Piketty says in A Brief History of Equality that Europe was running out of energy (trees) 
before we discovered fossil fuels. Baku and petroleum. Turkey Cyprus found gas in the land between them. 
Also Northern Cyprus. Greece naval power, now strategically located. Why not steam engine, from Patrick Collison?
Ukraine farmland. Algeria natural gas fracking energy.

<p> Clean energy abundance, <a href="https://www.aei.org/articles/how-to-build-a-future-of-clean-energy-abundance/">according 
to CEO of the Breakthrough Institute</a>, 
requires NEPA reform, more research and development, especially hydrogen, energy storage and batteries, 
also lots to do on agriculture. Nuclear and geothermal should probably replace natural gas over time.
<a href="https://www.thecgo.org/research/energy-superabundance/">Eli Dourado and Austin Vernon</a> have a fascinating 
article on how cheap abundant (and potentially more energy dense) energy can transform the world. Everything 
from cheaper and more transportation, to more reliable and better crops, to cities we cannot imagine.

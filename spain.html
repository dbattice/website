<h1>Spain</h1>
<p>
From January 2018 to May 2018, I studied in Seville, Spain. This was by far one of the best things I had ever done.
Here is a mostly week by week account of what I did.
Here are some select photos.

<p>
Brief things to do if you go to Spain:
</p>
<p>
Anywhere: get some churros, get tapas, go to a cafe (especially for pastry and coffee for breakfast or a midmorning snack),
go to El Corte Inglés, 
</p>
<p>
In Madrid, go the Royal Palace (Palacio Real) and look around for the plaza of kings and cathedral next to it, 
El Prado Museum, (CARS Museum, haven't been but a good art museum if you 
are into art museums), lunch from the Museo de Jamón and look around the Plaza Mayor, Primark store. Walk around the city, 
Take a day trip to Segovia(has Roman architecture, haven't been) or to El Escorial (don't miss the train) 
and have lunch in the town at a normal restaurant. See the Cuatro Torres?
</p>
<p>
In Seville, walk along the river and look for the stylish bridges, the Torre de Oro, Real Maestranza, 
Hospital de la Caridad, Rockets at the Aerospace center, Monestary of La Cartuja, Tower of Pabellon de la Navegación, 
walk along the Avenida de la Constitución, the Palace of San Telmo, the Real Fabrica de Tabacos,
go to the Cathedral of Seville and the Church of El Salvador, Archive of the Indies, 
Hotel Alfonso XIII (expensive coffee here but very cool building), Las Setas, 
Ayuntamiento and neighboring plazas, Palace of Las Dueñas and Condesa de Lebrija (haven't been but wanted to go)
Plaza de España and the Park of Maria Luisa, walk around Triana (has blue tiles called azulejos)
and Santa Cruz (formerly Jewish) neighborhoods, go into the Real Alcázar, Museum of Fine Arts (Museo de Bellas Artes), 
La Macarena Church (yes, the one in the song) and the Andalusian Parliament. Have a Cruzcampo beer and a glass of 
sherry and/or manzanilla. 
Go to Italica, birth place of Roman emperors Hadrian and Trajan, but also Roman architecture 
(haven't been but it was closed due to filming Game of Thrones when I wanted to go).
Could also go to Ronda (famous bridges and bull fighting ring and the cliffs) 
and Zahara de La Sierra, a quaint little town and one of the <i>pueblos blancos</i> or white villages  
(views of landscape, castle with said views, and a hiking trail that I didn't go on).
</p>
<p>
Cadiz is great for beaches, the main plaza is cool, and the cathedral is cool and offers amazing views of the city. 
Also check out the <i>puertas</i>. 
</p>
<p>
Palma is also good for beaches. Check out the cathedral if you can, it looks cool from a distance. Lots of other things 
places that look good for hiking or exploring, but I didn't do anything else. Have an ensaimada for breakfast. 
</p>
<p>
In Bilbao, San Sebastian, Toledo.
</p>
<p>
In Barcelona go to Placa Catalunya and Placa Espanya. Check out the Magic Fountain and look at a schedule. 
Go to Montjuic and the Barcelona Olympic stadium/museum. Guadi architecture. Go the the Sagrada Familia 
and DO NOT LOOK UP PICTURES BEFORE GOING. I want you to be amazed as I was when I first entered the building. 
Gothic quarter, La Rambla, Cathedral of Barcelona, Royal Palace, Placa de Jaume II and the Palace of the Generalitat,
go to Parc de la Ciudatella, Arc d'triofe, and the beaches.

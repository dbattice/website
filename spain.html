<h1>Spain</h1>
<p>
From January 2018 to May 2018, I studied in Seville, Spain. This was by far one of the best things I had ever done.
Here is a mostly week by week account of what I did.
Here are some select photos.
</p>
<p><a href="spainadventures.pdf">My brief sentences at the time of what I did each week</a></p>
<p>
Brief things to do if you go to Spain:
</p>
<p>
Anywhere: get some churros, get tapas, go to a cafe (especially for pastry and coffee for breakfast or a midmorning snack),
go to El Corte Inglés, eat jamón ibérico
</p>
<p>
In Madrid, go the Royal Palace (Palacio Real) and look around for the plaza of kings and cathedral next to it, 
El Prado Museum, (CARS Museum, haven't been but a good art museum if you 
are into art museums), lunch from the Museo de Jamón and look around the Plaza Mayor, Primark store. Walk around the city, 
Take a day trip to Segovia(has Roman architecture, haven't been) or to El Escorial (don't miss the train) 
and have lunch in the town at a normal restaurant. See the Cuatro Torres?
</p>
<p>
In Seville, walk along the river and look for the stylish bridges, the Torre de Oro, Real Maestranza, 
Hospital de la Caridad, rockets at the Aerospace center, Monestary of La Cartuja, Tower of Pabellon de la Navegación, 
walk along the Avenida de la Constitución, the Palace of San Telmo, the Real Fabrica de Tabacos (Royal Tabacco Factory),
go to the Cathedral of Seville and the Church of El Salvador, Archive of the Indies, 
Hotel Alfonso XIII (expensive coffee here but very cool building), Las Setas, 
Ayuntamiento and neighboring plazas, Palace of Las Dueñas and Condesa de Lebrija (haven't been but wanted to go),
Plaza de España (it is in Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones) and the Park of Maria Luisa, 
walk around Triana (has blue tiles called azulejos)
and Santa Cruz (formerly Jewish) neighborhoods, go into the Real Alcázar, Museo de Bellas Artes (Museum de Fine Arts), 
La Macarena Church (yes, the one in the song) and the Andalusian Parliament. Have a Cruzcampo beer and a glass of 
sherry and/or manzanilla. 
Go to Italica, birth place of Roman emperors Hadrian and Trajan, but also Roman architecture 
(haven't been but it was closed due to filming Game of Thrones when I wanted to go).
Could also go to Ronda (famous bridges and bull fighting ring and the cliffs) 
and Zahara de La Sierra, a quaint little town and one of the <i>pueblos blancos</i> or white villages  
(views of landscape, castle with said views, and a hiking trail that I didn't go on). 
</p>
<p>
Cadiz is great for beaches, the main plaza is cool, and the cathedral is cool and offers amazing views of the city. 
Also check out the <i>puertas</i>. 
</p>
<p>
Palma de Mallorca is also good for beaches. Check out the cathedral if you can, it looks cool from a distance. 
Lots of other things, including
places that look good for hiking or exploring, but I didn't do anything else. Have an ensaimada for breakfast. 
</p>
<p>
In Bilbao, walk around because it is the most modern city I went to. Check out the Riberia, the river, 
the bridges, Guggenheim Museum (don't have to go in), go to the top of the hill, find San Mamés Stadium,
find the main park and the Iberdrola Tower (Iberdrola is the biggest energy company in Spain). Also the Cathedral.
Go to Guernica (I didn't, but it is famous), and Gaztelugatze (especially if you watched Game of Thrones)
San Sebastian has an amazing beach (try to go to the island, I couldn't). Also has an old time seafood market, 
mostly underground. Cool architecture along the beachfront too. 
</p>
<p>
In Toledo, go to the churches, especially San Juan de Los Reyes, the Cathedral, and Church of Santo Tomé. 
Toledo has a history of being Jewish, Muslim, and Christian, so look for the famous mosque and synagogue.
Look for the Arabic buildings too. Walk around and see if you can find signs of this.
Toledo was also the capital of Spain (or rather Castille) for a few centuries. 
Try marzipan. Go the across the river and look back at the city especially the Alcazar of Toledo.
Toledo has a cool train/bus station. Go to the El Greco Museum/house. Read about El Greco before hand to understand his art.
DO NOT GO ZIP LINING.
</p>
<p>
In Barcelona go to Placa Catalunya and Placa Espanya. Check out the Magic Fountain and look at a schedule. 
Go to Montjuic and the Barcelona Olympic stadium/museum. Check out Guadi architecture. Go the the Sagrada Familia 
and DO NOT LOOK UP PICTURES BEFORE GOING. I want you to be amazed as I was when I first entered the building. 
Gothic quarter, La Rambla, Cathedral of Saint Eulalia, Royal Palace, Placa de Jaume II and the Palace of the Generalitat,
Parc de la Ciudatella, Arc de Triomf, and the beaches.

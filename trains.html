<h1>Trains</h1>

<p>
There is electricity to trains, (and substations) which face normal power tradeoffs. 
AC power can have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U9Nbe_L0eg">greater distances between substations</a>.
DC voltage is more efficient but transmission is more expensive (related to why most metros are DC voltage?). 
DC voltage is better for longer distances too? 
The <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektrificatie_van_spoorlijnen_in_Nederland">Netherlands choose</a> 
1.5 kV DC because it was easier to have lower voltage and provided more benefits over AC.</p> 
<p><a href="https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/heres-why-dc-is-used-in-most-trains-over-ac">Diesel electric trains 
are very common</a>, meaning that diesel powers the train, but the power output is put into a DC generator and then DC motors, 
which then powers the train wheels. This is because <a href="https://www.parvalux.com/us/advantages-of-dc-motors/">DC motors 
are easy to control and start with high torque</a>.They are also 
<a href="https://www.swartzengineering.com/Here%E2%80%99s-Why-DC-Is-Used-In-Most-Trains-Over-AC">cheap to manufacture 
and operate</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://nebula.tv/videos/rmtransit-the-best-way-to-power-your-transit">To get power to trains, 
you can either use catenary and pantographs (overhead wires) or use a third rail</a>. 
Overhead wires also have a mechanism to rotate the wires so the wire doesn't wear out on one side from repeated contact 
with the train. Third rails are common for metro systems. They do have to have more protection because of the live electricity, 
so they are not as common on longer or intercity lines. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MCfWPpJhXM">Temperature swings 
also have to be compensated for</a>.</p> 
<p>Then there is the electric power on board and to the motors, which will run power from the external source 
into rectifiers and inverters plus other things 
to get the desired voltage and current to the electric motors (and also convert some power for on board lights, screens, 
outlets, etc.).
<a href="http://railsystem.net/electric-traction-systems/">Here</a> are some diagrams of AC and DC electrification, 
assuming the motor runs on DC power.</p>
<p>Electric trains are driven by electric motors, specifically called tractions motors.
Traction motors used to be only series wound DC motors because they were easy to control. 
Series wound DC motors mean that the <a href="https://www.electricity-magnetism.org/series-wound-dc-motors/">windings 
in the armature and the field windings</a> are in series with each other. The field windings are the stationary coils 
around the stator, and the armature is the electrical connection on the moving rotor connected to the brushes. 
This results in <a href="https://www.eeworldonline.com/motor-fundamentals-dc-motors-faq/">high current and high starting 
torque</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_motor">making it ideal for accelerating a (heavy) train</a>. 
</p><p>In the last few decades they are using AC motors. 
<a href="https://www.powerelectronictips.com/faq-on-traction-motors-part-2/">AC motors are used</a> because 
there are better electronics now to control and optimize the motors, have lower maintenance costs, and 
have less weight for the same power output. There are both AC induction motors,
and synchronous AC motors (like on the TGV in France).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.explainthatstuff.com/induction-motors.html">Induction motors have less noise than DC motors, 
but also generate more heat</a>, which is usually mitigated by adding a fan and/or fins on the stator. 
Induction motors rely on a rotating magnetic field. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOC7uTnxmTI">As the AC power 
in the stator changes, the direction of the magnetic field changes</a>, 
which means that the magnetic attraction between the stator and rotor changes, which causes the rotor to rotate as 
the electromagnet in the rotor tries to 'catch up' to the magnetic field created by the coils in the stator. 
But it never does. If it does, <a href="https://www.electrical4u.com/induction-motor-types-of-induction-motor/"> 
then the mechanical forces will be zero and the rotor will not spin, but then the stator continues rotating 
the magnetic field which then creates slip again, and then the rotor starts rotating again</a>.
Induction motors with 
<a href="https://electricala2z.com/motors-control/types-single-phase-induction-motors-single-phase-induction-motor-wiring-diagram/">one 
phase will often split into two half phases, and often will have capacitors in the circuit to improve starting torque</a>, 
but it doesn't seem like single phase or split phase motors are that common on trains. I 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_motor">get</a> the 
<a href="https://www.lesics.com/how-does-an-electric-train-work.html">sense</a> that three phase induction 
motors are preferred on trains because of better torque, and trains are heavy so they need a lot of torque, especially 
when accelerating from rest.  
 </p> 
<p>The synchronous speed is the speed of the rotating magnetic field, <i>N<sub>s</sub></i>, 
the speed of the rotor is <i>N<sub>r</sub></i>, 
and the slip speed, <i>s</i>=(<i>N<sub>s</sub></i>-<i>N<sub>r</sub></i>)/<i>N<sub>s</sub></i>. The slip speed is usually 
about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQqyGNOP_3o">2% to 6%</a>. The synchronous speed is proportional to 
frequency, so by changing the frequency of the stator power input, you can change the speed of the motor. This is 
achieved by using a variable frequency drive. 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYQayMrK4Fo">More windings and poles in the induction motor means a smoother and less 
variable rotating field</a>.However, in three phase motors more poles comes at the 
<a href="https://www.kebamerica.com/blog/how-a-3-phase-ac-induction-motor-works/">cost of a lower motor RPM</a>.</p>
<p>
Also, 
<a href="https://www.powerelectronictips.com/faq-on-traction-motors-part-3/">permanent magnet synchronous motors</a>. 
<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/tee.20530">Permanent magnet synchronous 
motors are more efficient than induction motors</a>.

Note that the power to the electric motors on board can be DC or AC, 
or even converted from AC to DC, then to AC at the motors. To convert from DC power to AC motors, power is run through 
an inverter and a variable frequency drive. To convert from AC power to DC motors, the power is run through rectifiers.

Equations of power and voltage. Frequency. Scharfenberg vs Janney couplers.
The important things about electric motors are the frequency, the voltage, 
and the input power. 
AC motors will use the frequecy directly and on trains this usally aligns to the country's main electricity source frequency
(50 or 60 hertz) 
while having AC voltage of 15 or 25 kilovolts. The main exceptions here are Germany, Sweden, Norway, Austria, and Switzerland 
(16.7 Hz, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_kV_AC_railway_electrification">which used to be 16 and 2/3, 
which is exactly 1/3 of their electricity grid frequency of 50 hertz</a>). 
</p>
<p>So I was looking at train electrication and WTF <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acela">Acela</a>? 
Why do you have three different electrified systems, including different frequencies and 12 and 12.5 kilovolts on 
different segments of the route? 
This led me down a rabbit hole looking at the history of the Northeast Corridor. 
So the NEC was really merged into Amtrak and all the constituent lines were built by different companies 
at different times with different technologies and they sometimes copied nearby examples, 
like the Pennsylvania railroad which copied the New York New Haven and Hartford Railroad lines with 11 kV AC 25 Hz. 
This electrification was deemed good enough in the early 1900s because we werenâ€™t as good at electrification 
technology and struggled to make electrification work over longer distances, even though today it is much easier 
and cheaper and more efficient. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amtrak%27s_25_Hz_traction_power_system">This 
is why basically from New York City to DC and also SEPTA and 
also parts of lines in Connecticut use 25 Hz</a>, even though the rest of the NEC is 60 Hz.
In fact, there was a Connecticut supreme court decision banning third rail because it was too dangerous. 
This led to some experimentation by the New York New Haven and Hartford Line, where they 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification_of_the_New_York,_New_Haven,_and_Hartford_Railroad">settled on 
11 kilovolts AC as the optimal electrification system</a>, (AC being chosen because of the longer distances 
and third rail DC not an option). 25 Hz was chosen because there were several other lines already using 25 Hz, 
even though they thought that 15 Hz was better if you could start from scratch, due to lower losses. 
In the 1970s there was a plan to move the 25 Hz system to 60 Hz, but was deemed to expensive. 
Instead the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amtrak%27s_25_Hz_traction_power_system">voltage 
was increased from 11 kV to 12 kV</a>.
Also, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Jersey_Coast_Line">part of the NEC in New Jersey 
was originally the 11 kV AC 25 Hz</a>, but was moved to 12 kV 25 Hz AC in the 1970s, and now is 25 kV 60 Hz AC.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification_of_the_New_York,_New_Haven_and_Hartford_Railroad">Metro North</a>, 
which shares some of the NEC track, was converted from the 11 kV AC 25 Hz to 12 kV 25 Hz AC, 
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Haven_Line">then upgraded to 12.5 kV AC 60 Hz in the late 1980s 
when a power station got shut down for some reason</a>?
In the early 1990s, Congress passed a law to 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amtrak%27s_60_Hz_traction_power_system">convert Boston to New York</a> on the NEC 
to 25 kV AC 60 Hz. This was done to improve Amtrak solvency and reduce trip times. 
So that is a basic outline of why, which then leads to the question of why not standardize to 25 kV AC instead of 
12.5 kV AC or go even further and make the whole NEC 25 kV AC? The most obvious answer is that rewiring 
the hundreds of miles of 12kV 25 Hz would be very expensive for minimal gain, even though it would make 
people like me happy to see one unified electrification system. Also, there really isn't anything wrong 
with the current system other than new trains require slightly higher costs to be able to run on all three 
electrification systems. Also, 
<a href="https://railroad.net/25-kv-60-hz-ac-on-the-entire-northeast-corridor-t171590.html">increasing the voltage 
would require more clearance between the overhead wires and the train</a>, 
which would require a lot of work to make that extra room where ever that situation occurs. 
I still think it would be worth exploring making the 12.5 kV AC match the 25 kV AC like the rest of the NEC 
north of New York City, but that requires coordination with Metro-North and would probably have to be funded by Amtrak 
or the federal government to get them to agree. I would like to see a cost estimate of this though.

There are a few common railway gauges, which is the distance between the rails. As far as I can tell it doesn't 
matter that much. It matters because a wider gauge will tip less easily, but that can be corrected for with 
speed controls, weight controls, and a wider curve radius. Having a common gauge does make interoperability easier. 
It also is 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_gauge#Advantages_and_disadvantages_of_different_track_gauges">cheaper 
to build a narrower gauge as you need less material between rails and bridges can be 
smaller and less support needed on mountainous terrain, and more narrow rail cars and locomotives are cheaper</a>. 
There is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_gauge">standard gauge of 1435 millimeters</a>. 
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard-gauge_railway">gauge of 4 ft 8 in (1422 millimeters) was the 
first gauge used in England by George Stephenson eventually widened slightly (by 1/2 inch) to 1435 millimeters</a>, 
and then spread throught Britain and then the British Empire and got first mover advantage. Other places adopted 
the standard gauge so they could use the same trains, locomotives, and engineering experience too. 
<a href="https://www.trains.com/trn/railroads/history/track-gauge-different-degrees-of-separation/">Here 
is more detail on the Americas choosing the same standard gauge too</a>.
Iberian gauge of 1668 millimeters was chosen because they 
<a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancho_ib%C3%A9rico">thought the trend was towards wider gauges, 
and it would be better for mountainous terrain</a>. This gauge was 1671.6 millimeters, because of poor subcontracting 
and measurements I guess? In 1955, the Spanish rail company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renfe">RENFE</a>
converted all track to the current 1668 millimeters, reducing the gauge to have a tighter fit to make the rolling 
work better. Portugal soon followed by changing its gauge of 1665 millimeters up to the Iberian gauge. (It is important 
to note that high speed lines in Spain use standard gauge, along with a different electrification system.) 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_ft_3_in_gauge_railways">Irish gauge became standard in 1846 
on the island of Ireland</a>, with a width of 1600 millimeters. It was also used in 
Baden (now southwest Germany), New Zealand, Swizterland, and still used in Australia (more on that later) and Brazil. 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_ft_and_1520_mm_gauge_railways">The United States and United Kingdom 
used a gauge of 1524 millimeters early in their rail building 
but was not widespread. This gauge was chosen by the Russians in the 1840s, and spread throughout the empire</a>, 
It also spread to China, and lasted until the Japanese conquered parts of China and relaid 
some track as standard gauge. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport_in_Finland">Finnish gauge is 
1520 millimeters, 4 millimeters smaller than Russian gauge, even though they started railroads under the Russian Empire. 
Of course there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_gauge">other gauges</a>. 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_gauge_in_Australia">Australian chaos with gauges</a>, it wasn't always chaotic. 
Originally they were supposed to use British Standard gauge, and South Australia did adopt that standard. But 
<a href="https://nebula.tv/videos/rmtransit-australias-funky-rail-gauges">New South Wales 
and eventually other states tried to use a different gauge</a>, and some sates even appealed to Britain directly to 
try to force their preferred standard. Since each state established a standard there have been attempts and some successes 
to align to the standard gauge, probably most notably between Melbourne and Adelaide, and also in the state of Victoria.
Queensland is still mostly narrow gauge, the majority of track in Western Australia is standard, with a substantial 
minority of narrow, Victoria is almost 50/50 narrow and broad but definitely more broad gauge, and the rest is standard 
gauge.(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_gauge">Australia does make heavy use of dual gauge track on 
some of its rail lines</a>.)
No idea if they will ever get completely to one standard, but maybe as Australia expands it passenger rail 
network, they will use more and more standard, putting pressure on the states to convert more non-standard gauge 
rail to standard gauge? I don't know, but that seems like the most likely path to one gauge across all of Australia. 
(New Zealand uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport_in_New_Zealand">narrow gauge</a>, 
citing Queensland as a reason why, along with cheaper construction for a national standard.) 
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-European_Transport_Network">EU is planning to support 
Ukraine and Moldova to convert to standard gauge instead of Russian/Finnish gauge</a>. 
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport_in_Europe">EU also wants to standardize 
electrification and signaling</a> so any train can run anywhere. One concrete step is funding for 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_Baltica">Rail Baltica</a>, which is standard gauge route 
connecting Helsink or Tallin, capital of Estonia, with Warsaw and connecting the biggest cities 
in Estonia, Lativa, and Lithuania. </p>
